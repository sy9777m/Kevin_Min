<p>Equity securities that held for trading must be classified as FVPL.</p>

<p>Other equity securities may be classified as either fair value through profit or loss, or fair value through OCI. Once classified, the choice is irrevocable.</p>

<p>Derivatives that are not used for hedging are always carried at FVPL.</p>

<p>If an asset has an embedded derivatives (e.g., CB), the asset as a whole is valued at FVPL.</p>

<p>FVPL securities are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. The changes in fair value, both realized and unrealized, are recognized in the income statement along with any dividend or interest income.</p>

<h2 id="investments-in-associates">Investments in associates</h2>

<p>An ownership interests between 20% and 50% is typically a noncontrolling investment; however, the investor can usually significantly influence the investee’s business operations.</p>

<p>Under the equity method, the initial investment is recorded at cost and reported on the balance sheet as a <strong><span class="underline">noncurrent asset</span></strong>.</p>

<p>In subsequent periods, the proportionate share of the investee’s earnings increases the investment account on the investor’s balance sheet and is recognized in the investor’s income statement. Dividends received from the investee are treated as a return of capital and thus, reduce the investment amount. <strong><span class="underline">Dividends received from the investee are not recognized in the investor’s income statement.</span></strong></p>

<p>If the investee reports a loss, the investor’s proportionate share of the loss reduces the investment account and also lower earnings in the investor’s income statement. If the investee’s losses reduce the investment account to zero, the investor usually discontinues use of the equity method.</p>

<ul>
  <li>손실을 보다가 balance sheet의 investment 자산을 다 까먹으면 더 이상 손실을 인식하지 않음. (유한책임 반영) 다만, 주석에 반영</li>
</ul>

<p>The equity method is resumed once the proportionate shares of the investee’s earnings exceed the share of losses the were not recognized during the suspension period.</p>

<p>At the acquisition date, the excess of the purchase price over the proportionate share of the investee’s book value is allocated to the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities based on their fair values. Any remainder is considered goodwill.</p>

<ul>
  <li>투자자 입장에서 평가된 피투자사 balance sheet의 fair value of asset – fair value of liability를 통해 fair value of equity를 구하고, purchase price – fair value of equity = goodwill의 방식으로 계산</li>
</ul>

<p>In subsequent periods, the investor recognizes expense based on the excess amounts assigned to the investee’s assets and liabilities.</p>

<p>Under the equity method of accounting, the investor must adjust its balance sheet investment account and the proportionate share of the income reported from the investee for this additional expense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>비용도 fair value를 기준으로 계산해야 함. Inventory, PPE의 fair value를 높게 잡아줬다면, 비용도 그에 맞춰서 태우고, 이를 기준으로 산출한 NI의 proportionate shares를 equity method로 income statement에 equity income으로 가져옴.</li>

<h3 id="analytical-issues-for-investments-in-associates">Analytical issues for investments in associates</h3>

<p>Fair MV 변화 없을 경우, the equity method usually results in higher earnings as compared to the accounting methods used for minority passive investments.</p>

<p>The investor simply reports its proportionate share of the investee’s equity in one line on the balance sheet. By ignoring the investee’s debt, leverage is lower. In addition, the margin ratios are higher since the investee’s revenues are ignored.</p>

<p>The proportionate share of the investee’s earnings is recognized in the investor’s income statement, but the earnings may not be available to the investor in the form of cash flow (dividends). That is, the investee’s earnings may be permanently reinvested.</p>

<h3 id="goodwill">Goodwill</h3>

<p>Under the acquisition method, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired firm on the basis of fair value. Any remainder is reported on the balance sheet as goodwill. Goodwill is said to be an unidentifiable asset that cannot be separated from the business.</p>

<ul>
  <li>구매한 금액을 피투자사의 balance sheet에서 pro forma하게 나눠서 allocation하는데, 이 때 identifiable asset에만 allocation을 해야한다. 즉, 피투자사가 goodwill과 같이 unidentifiable asset을 가지고 있으면 해당 부분에는 allocation하지 않는다. Allocation을 다 하고 산출된 fair value of equity를 활용해서 purchase price – fair value of equity = goodwill을 계산한다.</li>
</ul>

<p>The full goodwill method results in higher total assets and higher total equity than the partial goodwill method. Thus, ROA and ROE will be lower if the full goodwill method is used.</p>

<p>Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment occurs when the carrying value exceed the fair value. Because of its inseparability, goodwill is valued at the reporting unit level.</p>

<h4 id="us-gaap-2">US GAAP</h4>

<p>Goodwill is the amount by which the fair value of the subsidiary is greater than the fair value of the subsidiary’s identifiable net assets (full goodwill).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Goodwill = fair value of 피투자사 - 피투자사의 fair value of equity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>둘은 엄연히 다르며, fair value of equity는 투자자가 바라보는 피투자사의 fair value of asset and liability를 통해 산출된 값을 의미하며, fair value of 피투자사는 투자자가 지불한 투자사의 equity의 market price로 이해하면 된다. 즉, purchase price.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>US GAAP는 full goodwill만 허용한다.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full goodwill은 goodwill을 산출할 때 내가 보유하지 않은 지분까지 전부 포함해서 산출하는 개념을 의미한다. 즉, NCI (non-controlling interest)도 fair value 평가를 해주는 개념.</li>
</ul>

<p>Goodwill impairment potentially involves two steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The carrying value of the reporting unit (including the good will) &gt; the fair value of the reporting unit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Impairment loss = difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The impairment loss is recognized in the income statement as a part of continuing operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The implied fair value of the goodwill is calculated in the same manner as goodwill at the acquisition date. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities as if they were acquired on the impairment measurement date. Any excess is considered the implied fair value of the goodwill.</p>

<h4 id="ifrs-1">IFRS</h4>

<p>Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquiring company’s proportion of the acquired company’s identifiable net assets (partial goodwill). However, IFRS permits the use of the full goodwill approach also.</p>

<p>Testing for impairment involves a single step approach.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The carrying amount of the cash generating unit (where the goodwill is assigned) &gt; the recoverable amount -&gt; impairment loss is recognized.</li>
</ol>

<!-- end list -->

<ul>
  <li>Recoverable amount = max(net selling price, value in use)</li>

Proportionate consolidation is similar to a business acquisition, except the investor (venturer) only reports the proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the joint ventures. Since only the proportionate share is reported, no minority owners’ interest is necessary.</p>

<p>Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation (PVDBO) – IFRS</p>

<p>All future pension benefits earned to date, based on expected future salary increases.</p>

<p>Annual Unit Credit (benefit) = value at retirement / number of years of service</p>

<p>Current Service Cost is the present value of benefits earned by the employees during the current period. Service cost includes an estimate of compensation growth (future salary increase) if the pension benefits are based on future compensation.</p>

<p>Interest cost is the increase in the obligation due to the passage of time. Benefit obligations are discounted obligations; thus, interest accrues on the obligation each period.</p>

<p>Interest cost = pension obligation at the beginning of the period * discount rate</p>

<p>Past (prior) service costs are retroactive benefits awarded to employees when a plan is initiated or amended. Under IFRS, past service costs are expensed immediately. Under US GAAP, past service costs are amortized over the average service life of employees.</p>

<p>The assumptions are similar for other post-employment benefits except the compensation growth rate is replaced by a health care inflation rate. Generally, the presumption is the inflation rate will taper off and eventually become constant. This constant rate is known as the ultimate health care trend rate.</p>

<p>All else equal, firms can reduce the post-employment benefit obligation and periodic expense by decreasing the near term health care inflation rate, by decreasing the ultimate health care trend rate, or by reducing the time needed to reach the ultimate health care trend rate.</p>

<p>If the shares are not publicly traded, an estimate of value must be used for stock grants. Unless the market price of the options is available, the value of stock options must be estimated using an options valuation model.</p>

<p>The compensation expense recorded is spread over the period of time from the grant date until the date on which they can be sold by the employee.

<p>Compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options on the grand date based on the number of options that are expected to vest. The vesting date is the first date the employee can actually exercise the options. The compensation expense is allocated in the income statement over the service period.</p>

<p>Recognition of compensation expense will decrease net income and retained earnings; however, paid-in capital is increased by an identical amount. This results in no change to total equity.</p>

<p>The difference between a stock appreciation right and an option is the form of payment. A stock appreciation award gives the employee the right to receive compensation based on the increase in the price of the firm’s stock over a predetermined amount. With stock appreciation rights, employees have limited downside risk and unlimited upside potential. Also, since no shares are actually issued, there is no dilution to existing shareholders. A disadvantage of stock appreciation rights is that they require current period cash outlay.</p>

<p>All income statement accounts are translated at the average rate.</p>

<p>All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate except for common stock, which is translated at the historical (actual) rate that applied when the stock was issued.</p>

<p>Dividends are translated at the rate that applied when they were declared.</p>

<p>Translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders’ equity as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA).</p>

<p>The CTA is simply a “plug” figure that forces the basic accounting equation (A = L + E) to balance.</p>

<p>Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using the current exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities are fixed in the amount of currency to be received or paid and include: cash, receivables, payables, and short-term and long-term debt.</p>

<p>All other assets and liabilities are considered nonmonetary and are remeasured at the historical (actual) rate. The most common nonmonetary assets include inventory, fixed assets, and intangible assets.</p>

<p>Just life the current rate method, common stock and dividends paid are remeasured at the historical (actual) rate.</p>

<p>Expenses related to nonmonetary assets such as COGS, depreciation expense, and amortization expense are remeasured based on the historical rates prevailing at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>Remeasurement gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. This results in more volatile net income as compared to the current rate method whereby the translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders’ equity.</p>

<p>Recall the ending inventory under FIFO consists of the costs from the most recently purchased goods. Thus, FIFO ending inventory is remeasured based on more recent exchange rates. On the other hand, FIFO COGS consists of costs that are older; thus, the exchange rates used to remeasure COGS are older.</p>

<p>Under LIFO, ending inventory consists of older costs; thus, the inventory is remeasured at older exchange rates. LIFO COGS, however, consists of costs from the most recently purchased goods; thus, COGS is remeasured based on more recent exchange rates.</p>

<p>The three pillars of the Basel III framework are the maintenance of minimum levels of capital, liquidity, and stable funding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Minimum required capital for a bank is based on the risk of the bank’s assets. The riskier a bank’s assets are, the higher its required capital.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basel III specifies that a bank should hold enough liquid assets to meet demands under a 30-day liquidity stress scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Basel III framework requires stable funding relative to a bank’s liquidity needs over a one-year time horizon. Stability in funding is proportional to the tenor of the bank’s deposits; longer-term deposits are more stable than shorter-term deposits. Stability also depends on the type of deposit.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Financial-Reporting-and-Analysis-Review/media/image50.png" alt="A blackboard with yellow writing Description automatically generated with low confidence" /></p>

<p>Capital adequacy is based on risk-weighted assets (RWA); more risky assets require a higher level of capital.</p>

<p>Basel III defines a bank’s capital in a tiered, hierarchical approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 1 capital:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Common equity Tier 1 capital (the most important component): Common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and OCI less intangibles and deferred tax assets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Other Tier 1 capital: subordinated instruments with no specified maturity and no contractual dividends (e.g., preferred stock with discretionary dividends).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 2 capital: subordinated instruments with original (i.e., when issued) maturity of more than five years.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Individual jurisdictions specify the minimum capital requirements. Basel III guidelines specify a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 4.5% of RWA, minimum total Tier 1 capital of 6% of RWA, and minimum total capital of 8% of RWA.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Financial-Reporting-and-Analysis-Review/media/image52.png" alt="A picture containing text, blackboard Description automatically generated" /></p>

<p>Evaluation of asset quality includes analysis of current and potential credit risk associated with the bank’s assets.</p>

<p>Bank assets include loans (the largest component) and investments in securities. While loans are generally carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost (net of allowances), the accounting treatment for investments in securities differs between US GAAP and IFRS.</p>

<h2 id="credit-risk-analysis">Credit Risk Analysis</h2>

<p>Credit risk is present in debt securities that the bank invests in, loans the bank makes, as well as in the bank’s off-balance-sheet liabilities. Analyzing the credit quality of a bank’s assets can provide an analyst key insights into the bank’s solvency and future profitability.</p>

<h3 id="key-loans">Key loans</h3>

  <li>
    <p>Seriously impaired</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="loan-loss-provisions">Loan Loss Provisions</h2>

<p>The credit quality of loans and loss provisions are critical in evaluating the bank’s financial position and performance. Allowance for loan losses is a contra asset account to loans and is the result of provision for loan losses, an expense subject to management discretion. Analysts need to evaluate the bank’s policy of setting aside adequate provisions relative to actual loan performance. Actual losses (net of recoveries) are then written off against these provisions.</p>

<p>Earnings are considered high quality if they are adequate as well as sustainable. Ideally, the trend in earnings should be positive and the underlying accounting estimates should be unbiased. Finally, earnings should ideally be derived from recurring sources.</p>

<p>A major source of earnings of a bank is from investment in securities. Estimates used in the valuation of these securities may lead to biased earnings.</p>

<p>Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices of identical assets.</p>

<p>Level 2 inputs are observable but not quoted prices of identical assets.</p>

<p>Level 3 inputs are non-observable and hence subjective.</p>

<p>In practice, banks often use the fair value hierarchy to label their assets or to label their valuation methodology.</p>

<p>For a typical bank, major sources of earnings are (1) net interest income, (2) service income, and (3) trading income. Of these, trading income is the most volatile year-to-year, and, hence, on a relative basis, banks with proportionally higher net interest income and service income would have more sustainable earnings.</p>

<h3 id="liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr">Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)</h3>

<p>LCR = highly liquid assets / expected cash outflows</p>

<p>Highly liquid assets are those that are easily convertiable into cash, while expected cash flows are the estimated on-month liquidity needs in a stress scenario. The standards recommend a minimum LCR of 100%.</p>

<h3 id="net-stable-funding-ratio-nsfr">Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)</h3>

<p>NSFR = available stable funding / required stable funding</p>

<p>Available stable funding is a function of the composition and maturity distribution of a bank’s funding sources. Required stable funding is a function of the composition and maturity distribution of the bank’s asset base.</p>

<p>NSFR relates the liquidity needs of a bank’s assets to the liquidity provided by the bank’s liabilities. Longer-dated liabilities are considered more stable and hence would be suitable to fund assets with longer maturities. Deposits from retail and small business clients are considered more stable than deposits from corporate clients. The standards recommend a minimum NSFR of 100%.</p>

<p>Other liquidity monitoring metrics recommended by Basel III include concentration of funding and maturity mismatch.</p>

<h2 id="sensitivity-to-market-risk">Sensitivity to Market Risk</h2>

<p>The most critical of various market risks is interest rate risk. A bank’s interest rate risk is the result of differences in maturity, rates, and repricing frequency between the bank’s assets and its liabilities.</p>

<p>The impact of market risk can be captured by value at risk (VaR).</p>

<p>Insurance company revenues include premium income and income on float.</p>

<p>Property and casualty (P\&amp;C) insurers differ from life and health (L\&amp;H) insurers in terms of variability of claims and contract duration. Claims form P\&amp;V insurers tend to be lumpier as compared to relatively stable and predictable claims for L\&amp;H insurers. Contract duration is much higher for L\&amp;H insurers relative to that of P\&amp;C insurers. Regulatory requirements that focus on solvency of insurance companies often result in different reporting standards compared to IFRS or US GAAP.</p>

<h2 id="pc-insurance-companies">P\&amp;C Insurance Companies</h2>

<p>Premium income is usually the highest source of income for a P\&amp;C insurer. Keys to the profitability of an insurer are prudence in underwriting, pricing of adequate premiums for bearing risk, and diversification of risk. To diversify their risks, insurers often reinsure some risks. The policy period is often very short, with premiums received at the beginning of the period and invested during the float period. Claim events are clearly defined but may take a long time to emerge.</p>

<p>Property insurance covers specific assets against loss due to insured events. Casualty insurance protects against a legal liability due to the occurrence of a covered event. Sometimes a poly, known as multiple peril policy, may cover both property and casualty losses occurring during a covered event.</p>

<h2 id="pc-profitability">P\&amp;C Profitability</h2>

<p>P\&amp;C margins are cyclical. During periods of heightened competition, price cutting to obtain new business leads to slim or negative margins (soft pricing period). This soft pricing period leads to losses and a shrinking capital base for many insurers, who either leave the industry or stop underwriting new policies. The resulting reduction in competition leads to a healthier pricing environment (hard pricing period), which in turn results in fatter margins. Higher margins during the hard pricing period attract new competition, perpetuating the cycle.</p>

<p>Major expenses for P\&amp;C insurers include claims expense and the expense of obtaining new policy business. The cost of writing new policies depends on whether the insurer uses a direct-to-customer model (in which case it would bear the fixed cost of staffing) or the agency model (in which case it would pay variable commissions). Soft or hard pricing is driven by the industry’s combined ratio (total insurance expenses / net premiums earned). When the ratio is low (high), it is a hard (soft) market.</p>

<p>For a single insurer, a combined ratio in excess of 100% indicates an underwriting loss.</p>

<p>Underwriting loss ratio (loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) = (claims paid + delta of loss reverse) / net premium earned</p>

<p>Expense ratio (underwriting expense ratio) = underwriting expenses including commissions / net premium written</p>

<p>The underwriting loss ratio measures the relative efficiency of the company’s underwriting standards (whether the policies are priced appropriately relative to risks borne), while the expense ratio measures the efficiency of the company’s operations.</p>

<p>For reporting purposes, sometimes insurers use US GAAP, which calls for net premium earned as the denominator for both ratios.</p>

<p>The loss reverse is an estimated value of unpaid claims (based on estimated losses incurred during the reporting period). Subject to management discretion in measurement, the loss reserve is a highly material amount. Insurers revise their estimate of the loss reserve as more information becomes available. Downward revisions indicate that the company was conservative in estimating their losses in the first place. Upward revisions indicate aggressive profit booking, a warning sign for analysts.</p>

<h2 id="investment-returns">Investment returns</h2>

<p>Total investment return ratio = total investment income / invested assets</p>

<p>Total investment return ratio is used to evaluate the performance of an insurer’s investment operations.</p>

<h2 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h2>

<p>Liquidity is an important consideration for P\&amp;C insurers as they stand ready to meet their claim obligations. One way to gauge the liquidity of the investment portfolio is to look at their fair value hierarchy reporting.</p>

<h2 id="capitalization">Capitalization</h2>

<p>There are no global risk-based capital requirement standards for insurers.

<p>The Beneish model is a probit regression model that estimates the probability of earnings manipulation using eight dependent variables. The M-score determines the probability of earnings manipulation – higher values indicate high probabilities.</p>

<p>M-score &gt; -1.78 indicates a higher-than-acceptable probability of earnings manipulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DSRI (Days sales receivable index) – ratio of days’ sales receivables in year t relative to year t – 1. A large increase in DSRI could be indicative of revenue inflation.</p>

  <li>
    <p>GMI (Gross margin index) – ratio of gross margin in year t – 1 to that in year t. a firm with declining margins is more likely to manipulate earnings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AQI (Asset quality index) – ratio of non-current assets other than plant, property, and equipment to total assets in year t relative to year t – 1. Increases in AQI could indicate excessive capitalization of expenses.</p>

  <li>
    <p>DEPI (Depreciation index) – ratio of depreciation rate in year t – 1 to the corresponding rate in year t. the depreciation rate is depreciation expense divided by depreciation plus PPE.

<p>Accrual accounting requires considerable subjectivity because of the many estimates and judgments involved with assigning revenues and expenses to appropriate periods. Due to this subjectivity in revenue and expense recognition, disaggregating income into its two major components, cash and accruals, further enhances its quality as an input for forecasting future earnings. The accrual component of income is less persistent than the cash component.</p>

<p>When examining net income, analysts should be aware that earnings at extreme levels tend to revert back to normal levels over time. This phenomenon is known as mean reversion. Because of mean reversion, analysts should not expect extreme earnings to continue indefinitely. When earnings are largely comprised of accruals, mean reversion will occur faster.</p>

<h2 id="sources-of-earnings-and-return-on-equity">Sources of earnings and return on equity</h2>

<p>ROE = Tax Burden * Interest Burden * EBIT margin * Total Asset Turnover * Financial Leverage</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Financial-Reporting-and-Analysis-Review/media/image59.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated" /></p>

<p>We must also consider the firm’s sources of income and whether the income is generated internally from operations or externally.</p>

<p>Eliminating the equity income from the investor’s earnings permits analysis of the investor’s performance resulting exclusively from its own asset base. Since, under the equity method, the firm’s investment is reported as a balance sheet asset, total assets should be reduced by the carrying value of investment.</p>

<p>Another common adjustment made by analysts is to remove the effects of any unusual items (e.g., provisions for restructuring and litigation, goodwill impairment, etc.) from reported operating earnings (EBIT) before computing the EBIT margin and the tax burden ratios.</p>

<h2 id="asset-base">Asset base</h2>

<p>Analysis of the asset base requires an examination of changes in the composition of balance sheet assets over time.</p>

<p>Since goodwill is no longer amortized through the income statement, we must consider the possibility of losses in the future if goodwill is determined to have been impaired.</p>

<h2 id="capital-structure">Capital structure</h2>

<p>A firm’s capital structure must be able to support management’s strategic objectives as well as to allow the firm to honor its future obligations.</p>

<h2 id="capital-allocation-decisions">Capital allocation decisions</h2>

<p>Consolidated financial statements can hide the individual characteristics of dissimilar subsidiaries. As a result, firms are required to disaggregate financial information by segments to assists users.</p>

<p>Accrual-based measures such as EBIT may not be a good indicator of an entity’s ability to generate cash flow. We would rather evaluate segmental capital allocation decisions based on cash flows generated by each segment. However, segmental cash flow data is generally not reported. We can, however, approximate cash flow as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization.</p>

<h2 id="accruals-ratio">Accruals ratio</h2>

<h3 id="balance-sheet-approach">Balance sheet approach</h3>

<p>Accruals BS = ending NOA – beginning NOA</p>

<p>Net Operating Assets (NOA) = Operating assets – Operating liabilities</p>

<p>Operating assets = total assets – cash, equivalents to cash, marketable securities</p>

<p>Operating liabilities = total liabilities – total debt (both short term and long term)</p>

<p>Accruals ratio BS = (ending NOA – beginning NOA) / ((ending NOA + beginning NOA) / 2)</p>

<h3 id="cash-flow-statement-approach">Cash flow statement approach</h3>

<p>Accruals CF = NI – CFO – CFI</p>

<p>Accruals ratio CF = (NI – CFO – CFI) / ((ending NOA – beginning NOA) / 2)</p>

<p>In order to compare the two measures, it is necessary to eliminate cash paid for interest and taxes from operating cash flow by adding them back. This adjusted figure is the cash generated from operations (CGO).</p>

<p>CGO = EBIT + non-cash charges – increase in working capital</p>

<p>CGO / operating income ratio 사용함</p>

<h2 id="market-value-decomposition">Market value decomposition</h2>

<p>When a parent company has an ownership interest in an associate (subsidiary or affiliate), it may be beneficial to determine the standalone value of the parent; that is, the implied value of the parent without regard to the value of the associate. The implied value is equal to the parent’s market value less the parent’s pro-rata share of the associate’s market value. If the associate’s stock is traded on a foreign stock exchange, it may be necessary to convert the market value of the associate to the parent’s reporting currency.</p>
