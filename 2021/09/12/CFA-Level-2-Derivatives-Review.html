<h2 id="forward-contract">Forward contract</h2>

<p>Long forward position – agrees to buy the financial or physical asset</p>

<p>Short forward position – agrees to sell/deliver the asset</p>

<p>Typically, no money changes hands at the inception of the contract, unlike futures contracts.</p>

<p>At any point in time, forward contract is a zero-sum game.</p>

<h3 id="the-no-arbitrage-principle">The no-arbitrage principle</h3>

<p>Forward price refers to the forward price of the underlying.</p>

<p>No-arbitrage principle - The price that we wish to determine is the forward price that makes the values of both the long and the short positions zero at contract initiation. There should be no riskless profit to be gained by a combination of a forward contract position with positions in other assets.</p>

<p>This principle assumes that (1) transactions costs are zero, (2) there are no restrictions on short sales or the use of short sale proceeds, and (3) both borrowing and lending can be done in unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate of interest.</p>

<p>Forward price = price that prevents profitable riskless arbitrage in frictionless markets</p>

<p>Clean price는 해당 주기에서의 bond 가격</p>

<p>Full price는 실제 bond market에서 거래되는 가격, 해당 bond를 사려면 지불해야 하는 실제 가격 – accrued interest 포함</p>

<p>UST – semiannual</p>

<p>Bond futures contracts often allow the short an option to deliver any of several bonds, which will satisfy the delivery terms of the contract. This is called a delivery option and is valuable to the short. Each bond is given a conversion factor that is used to adjust the long’s payment at delivery so the more valuable bonds receive a lager payment. These factors are multipliers for the futures price at settlement. The long pays the futures price at expiration, multiplied by the conversion factor (CF).</p>

<p><img src="https://sy9777m.github.io/Kevin_Min/assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Derivatives-Review/media/image14.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>가격표시는 clean price로 되지만, 실제 futures price를 거래할 때는 accrued interest의 현재가치를 빼준 full price를 사용해야 한다.</p>

<h2 id="pricing-forward-rate-agreements">Pricing forward rate agreements</h2>

<p>LIBOR – London Interbank Offered Rate</p>

<p>It is quoted as an annualized rate based on a 360-day year.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Derivatives-Review/media/image18.png" alt="A picture containing text, blackboard Description automatically generated" /></p>

<p>The long position in a forward rate agreement (FRA) is the party that is effectively borrowing money (long the loan, with the contract price being the interest rate on the loan).</p>

<h3 id="pricing-fras">Pricing FRAs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>LIBOR rates in the Eurodollar market are add-on rates and are always quoted on a 30/360 day basis in annual terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long position in an FRA is, in effect, long the rate and benefits when the rate increases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the interest on the underlying loan won’t be paid until the end of the loan. Therefore, the payoff on the FRA is the present value of the interest savings on the loan.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The forward price in an FRA is actually a forward interest rate.</p>

<h2 id="futures-contract">Futures contract</h2>

<p>Futures contract are very much like the forward contracts except that they trade on organized exchanges.</p>

<p>To safeguard the clearinghouse, the exchange requires both sides of the trade to post margin and settle their accounts on a daily basis. Thus, the margin in the futures markets is a performance guarantee.</p>

<p>Marking to market is the process of adjusting the margin balance in a futures account each day for the change in the value of the contract from the previous trading day, based on the settlement price.</p>

<p>Like forward contracts, futures contracts have no value at contract initiation. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts do not accumulate value changes over the term of the contract. Since futures accounts are marked to market daily, the value after the margin deposit has been adjusted for the day’s gains and losses in contract value is always zero.</p>

<p>One party agrees to pay floating (borrow at the floating rate) and receive fixed (lend at a fixed rate). At initiation of the swap, the fixed rate is selected so that the present value of the floating-rate payments is equal to the present value of the fixed-rate payments, which means the swap value is zero to both parties. This fixed rate is called the swap fixed rate.</p>

<p>A binomial model is based on the idea that, over the next period, the value of an asset will change to one of two possible values (binomial). To construct a binomial model, we need to know the beginning asset value, the size of the two possible changes, and the probability of each of these changes occurring.</p>

<h2 id="american-option">American option</h2>

<p>While the early exercise feature is not valuable for call options on non-dividend paying stocks, deep-in-the-money put options could benefit from early exercise. When an investor exercises an option early, she captures only the intrinsic value of the option and forgoes the time value. While the intrinsic value can be invested at the risk-free rate, the interest so earned is less than the time value in most cases. For deep-in-the-money put option, the upside is limited. In such cases, the interest on intrinsic value can exceed the option’s time value.</p>

<p>American-style call options on dividend-paying stocks can be evaluated similarly. For dividend-paying stocks the stock price falls when the stock goes ex-dividend, and it may take sense to exercise the call option before such a decline in price.</p>

<p>The BSM option valuation model values options in continuous time, but it based on the no-arbitrage condition we used in valuing options in discrete time with a binomial model. To derive the BSM model, an instantaneously riskless portfolio (one that is riskless over the next instant) is used to solve for the option price.</p>

<p>The assumptions underlying the BSM model are</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The underlying asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion process. Therefore, the asset price has a lognormal distribution. In other words, the continuous compounded return is normally distributed. Under this framework, change in asset price is continuous: there are no abrupt jumps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuous compounded risk-free rate is constant and known. Borrowing and lending are both at the risk-free rate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The volatility of the returns from inception to maturity on the underlying asset is constant and known. The price of the underlying changes smoothly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Markets are frictionless. There are no taxes, no transactions costs, and no restrictions on short sales or the use of short-sale proceeds. Continuous trading is possible, and there are no arbitrage opportunities in the marketplace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuously compounded yield from inception to maturity on the underlying asset is constant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The options are European options.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="delta">Delta</h2>

<p>Delta describes the relationship between changes in asset prices and changes in option prices. Delta is also the hedge ratio. Call option deltas are positive because as the underlying asset price increases, call option value also increases. Conversely, the delta of a put option is negative because put value falls as the asset price increases.</p>

<h3 id="interpreting-delta">Interpreting Delta</h3>

<p>The bottom line is that a call option’s delta will increase from 0 to 1 as non-dividend paying stock price increase. For a non-dividend paying stock, the put delta increases from -1 to 0 as the stock price increases.</p>

<h2 id="gamma">Gamma</h2>

<p>Gamma measures the rate of changes in delta as the underlying stock price changes. Gamma captures the curvature of the option-value-versus-stock-price relationship. Long positions in calls and puts have positive gamma.</p>

<p>Gamma is highest for at-the-money options. Deep-in-the-money or deep-out-of-the-money options have low gamma. Gamma changes with stock price and with time to expiration. To lower (increase) the overall gamma of a portfolio, one should short (go long) options.</p>

<p>Call and put options on the same underlying asset with the same exercise price and time to expiration will have equal gammas.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Derivatives-Review/media/image75.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated" /></p>

<h2 id="vega">Vega</h2>

<p>Vega measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the volatility of returns on the underlying asset. Both call and put options are more valuable, all else equal, the higher the volatility, so vega is positive for both calls and puts.</p>

<h1 id="rho">Rho</h1>

<p>Rho measures the sensitivity of the option price to change in the risk-free rate.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/2021-09-12-CFA-Level-2-Derivatives-Review/media/image76.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated with low confidence" /></p>

<h2 id="theta">Theta</h2>

<p>Theta measures the sensitivity of option price to the passage of time. As time passes and a call option approaches maturity, its speculative value declines, all else equal. This is called time decay. That behavior also applied for most put options (though deep in-the-money put options closed to maturity may actually increases in value as time passes). Because it is a measure of time decay, theta is less than zero: as time passes and the option approaches the maturity date, the option value decreases (holding other factors constant).</p>

<h1 id="los-38l-describe-how-a-delta-hedge-is-executed">LOS 38.l: Describe how a delta hedge is executed.</h1>

<p>The goal of a delta-neutral portfolio or delta-neutral hedge is to combine a long position in a stock with a short position in a call option so that the value of the portfolio does not change as the stock price changes.</p>

<p>Number of short call options needed to delta hedge = number of shares hedged / delta of call option</p>

<p>Number of long put options needed to delta hedge = - number of shares hedged / delta of put option</p>

<p>A key consideration in delta-neutral hedging is that the delta hedged asset position is only risk-free for a very small change in the value of the underlying stock. The delta-neutral portfolio must be continually rebalanced to maintain the hedge; for this reason, it is called a dynamic hedge.</p>

<h1 id="los-38m-describe-the-role-of-gamma-risk-in-option-trading">LOS 38.m: Describe the role of gamma risk in option trading.</h1>

<p>Gamma risk is therefore the risk that the stock price might abruptly jump leaving an otherwise delta-hedged portfolio unhedged.</p>

<p>Consider a delta hedge involving a long position in stock and short position in calls. If the stock price falls abruptly, the loss in the long stock position will not equal to gain in the short call position. This is the gamma risk of the hedge.</p>

<p>Because a stock’s delta is always 1, its gamma is 0. A delta-hedged portfolio with a long position in stocks and a short position in calls with have negative net gamma exposures.</p>

<h1 id="los-38n-define-implied-volatility-and-explain-how-it-is-used-in-options-trading">LOS 38.n: Define implied volatility and explain how it is used in options trading.</h1>

<p>Future volatility is one of the inputs in the BSM model. Estimates based on historical volatility are often used because future volatility is not directly observable.</p>

<p>Traders often use implied volatilities to gauge market perceptions.</p>

<p>Traders can also used implied volatility as a mechanism to quote option prices.</p>
