            "content": ". LOS 32.a: Describe relationships among spot rates, forward rates, yield to maturity, expected and realized returns on bonds, and the shape of the yield curve. . Spot rates . Spot rates are the annualized market interest rates for a single payment to be received in the future. Generally, we use spot rates for government securities (risk-free) to generate the spot rate curve. . The spot interest rate is the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon bond. . The term structure of spot rates is known as the spot curve. The shape and level of the spot curve changes continuously with the market prices of bonds. . Forward rates . The annualized interest rate on a loan to be initiated at a future period is called the forward rate for that period. . The term structure of forward rates is called the forward curve. . Forward curves and spot curves are mathematically related. . Yield to maturity . . YTM of a zero-coupon bond with maturity T is the spot interest rate for a maturity of T. . For a coupon bond, if the spot rate curve is not flat, the YTM will not be the same as the spot rate. . The yield on a coupon bond is a weighted average of three spot rates. . Expected and realized returns on bonds . . Expected return is the ex-ante holding period return that a bond investor expects to earn. The expected return will be equal to the bond’s yield only when all three of the following are true: . The bond is held to maturity . | All payments (coupon and principal) are made on time and in full . option-free, no default risk, no prepayment risk | . | All coupons are reinvested at the original YTM . If the yield curve is not flat, the coupon payments will not be reinvested at the YTM and the expected return will differ from the yield. | . | . . Realized return on a bond refers to the actual return that the investor experiences over the investment’s holding period. Realized return is based on actual reinvestment rates. . LOS 32.b: Describe the forward pricing and forward rate models and calculate forward and spot prices and rates using those models. . The forward pricing model . . Forward price는 현재 spot price에 투자하는 대신 무위험 수익률을 노렸을 경우의 가치와 동일하다. 그래서 forward price를 risk-free rate으로 할인하면 현재 시점의 spot price와 같은 값이 나오는 것. 이게 arbitrage-free pricing . 현재 시점에서 Forward contract value는 0 . The forward rate model . . . This model is useful because it illustrates how forward rates and spot rates are interrelated. . Spot rate과 forward rate은 geometric average 관계 . Spot curve가 upward sloping이면 forward rate은 항상 spot rate보다 크고, 그러므로 forward curve는 spot curve 위에 위치한다. Spot curve가 downward sloping이면, forward rate은 spot rate보다 항상 작고, 그러므로 forward curve는 spot curve 밑에 위치한다. . . LOS 32.c: Describe how zero-coupon rates (spot rates) may be obtained from the par curve by bootstrapping. . . . A par rate is the yield to maturity of a bond trading at par. Generally, par curve refers to the par rates for government or benchmark bonds. . By using a process called bootstrapping, spot rates or zero-coupon rates can be derived from the par curve. . LOS 32.d: Describe the assumptions concerning the evolution of spot rates in relation to forward rates implicit in active bond portfolio management. . Relationships between spot and forward rates . For an upward-sloping spot curve the forward rate rises as increases. For downward-sloping spot curve, the forward rate declines as increases. For an upward-sloping spot curve, the forward curve will be above the spot curve. Conversely, when the spot curve is downward sloping, the forward curve will be below it. . The spot rate for a long-maturity security will equal the geometric mean of a series of one-year forward rates. . Forward price evolution . . Forward rate는 현재 상황에서 관찰된 미래 시점의 단위기간 금리일 뿐, 시간이 지나면 변화한다. 그러므로 forward contract들도 expiration이 되면 해당 시점의 contract value와 forward price가 다를 수 있다. 만기 시점의 contract value = forward price이려면, 계약 시점에 관찰된 forward rate가 미래인 만기 시점에 spot rate로 정확히 실현되어야 한다. . If the future spot rates actually evolve as forecasted by the forward curve, the forward price will remain unchanged. Therefore, a change in the forward price indicates that the future spot rate(s) did not conform to the forward curve. When spot rates turn out to be lower (higher) than implied by the forward curve, the forward price will increase (decrease). A trader expecting lower future spot rates (then implied by the current forward rates) would purchase the forward contract to profit from its appreciation. . For a bond investor, the return on a bond over a one-year horizon is always equal to the one-year risk-free rate if the future spot rates evolve as predicted by today’s forward curve. If the spot curve one year from today is not the same as that predicted by today’s forward curve, the return over the one-year period will differ, with the return depending on the bond’s maturity. . An active portfolio manager will try to outperform the overall bond market by predicting how the future spot rates will differ from those predicted by the current forward curve. . If an investor believes that future spot rates will be lower than corresponding forward rates, then she will purchase bonds (at a presumably attractive price) because the market appears to be discounting future cash flows at “too high” of a discount rate. . . LOS 32.e: Describe the strategy of riding the yield curve. . Riding the yield curve (YTM curve) . . With an upward-sloping interest rate term structure, investors seeking superior returns may pursue a strategy called riding the yield curve (also known as rolling down the yield curve). Under this strategy, an investor will purchase bonds with maturities longer than his investment horizon. In an upward-sloping yield curve, shorter maturity bonds have lower yields than longer maturity bonds. As the bond approaches maturity, it is valued using successively lower yields and, therefore, at successively higher prices. . If the yield curve remains unchanged over the investment horizon, riding the yield curve strategy will produce higher returns than a simple maturity matching strategy, increasing the total return of a bond portfolio. The greater the difference between the forward rate and the spot rate, and the longer the maturity of the bond, the higher the total return. (shoulder effect) . LOS 32.f: Explain the swap rate curve and why and how market participants use it in valuation. . The swap rate curve . . In a plain vanilla interest rate swap, one party makes payments based on a fixed rate while the counterparty makes payments based on a floating rate. The fixed rate in an interest rate swap is called the swap fixed rate or swap rate. . LOS 32.g: Calculate and interpret the swap spread for a given maturity. . Swap spread . Swap spread refers to the amount by which the swap rate exceeds the yield of a government bond with the same maturity . Swap spread = SFR – treasury yield . Swap spread는 banking industry의 credit risk를 반영 . Swap spreads are almost always positive, reflecting the lower credit risk of governments compared to the credit risk of surveyed banks that determines the swap rate. . I-spread . . The I-spread for a credit-risky bond is the amount by which the yield on the risky bond exceeds the swap rate for the same maturity. The missing swap rate can be estimated from the swap rate curve using linear interpolation. . I-spread = credit-risky bond yield – SFR . While a bond’s yield reflects time value as well as compensation for credit and liquidity risk, I-spread only reflects compensation for credit and liquidity risks. The higher the I-spread, the higher the compensation for liquidity and credit risk. . LOS 32.h: Describe the Z-spread . The Z-spread . . The Z-spread is the spread that, when added to each spot rate on the default-free spot curve, makes the present value of a bond’s cash flows equal to the risky bond’s market price. Therefore, the Z-spread is a spread over the entire spot rate curve. . The term zero volatility in the Z-spread refers to the assumption of zero interest rate volatility. Z-spread is not appropriate to use to value bonds with embedded options. . Los 32.i: Describe the TED and LIBOR-OIS spreads. . . TED spread . The TED in TED spread is an acronym that combines the T in T-bill with ED, the ticker symbol for the Eurodollar futures contract. . TED spread = 3-month LIBOR rate – 3-month T-bill rate . Because T-bill are considered to risk free while LIBOR reflects the risk of lending to commercial banks, the TED spread is seen as an indication of the risk of interbank loans. A rising TED spread indicates that market participants believe banks are increasingly likely to default on loans and that risk-free T-bill are becoming more valuable in comparison. The TED spread captures the risk in the banking system more accurately than does the 10-year swap spread. . SFR은 long-term rate . OIS spread . OIS stands for overnight indexed swap. The OIS rate roughly reflects the federal funds rate and includes minimal counterparty risk. 거의 credit risk 없음 . The OIS spread is the amount by which the LIBOR rate which includes credit risk exceeds the OIS rate which includes only minimal credit risk. This makes the OIS spread a useful measure of credit risk and an indication of the overall wellbeing of the banking system. Credit risk도 포함되어 있지만, OIS spread는 liquidity를 더 잘 반영함 . A low OIS spread is a sign of high market liquidity while a high OIS spread is a sign of high market liquidity while a high OIS spread is a sign that banks are unwilling to lend due to concerns about creditworthiness. . 낮을수록 High liquidity, 높을수록 low liquidity . LOS 32.j: Explain traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates and describe the implications of each theory for forward rates and the shape of the yield curve. . Term structure를 해석하려는 theory를 의미 . Term structure of interest rates에서 interest rates는 순수한 화폐의 시간가치만 반영한 spot rate, forward rate를 의미 . . . . Unbiased expectation theory . Pure expectation theory . We hypothesize that it is investors’ expectations that determine the shape of the interest rate term structure. . Specifically, this theory suggests that forward rates are solely a function of expected future spot rates, and the every maturity strategy has the same expectation return over a given investment horizon. In other words, long-term interest rates equal the mean of future expected short-term rates. This implies that an investor should earn the same return by investing in a five-year bond or by investing in a three-year bond and then a two-year bond after the three-year bond matures. Similarly, an investor with a three-year investment horizon would be indifferent between investing in a three-year bond or in a five-year bond that will be sold two years prior to maturity. The underlying principle behind the pure expectations theory is risk neutrality. . The implications for the shape of the yield curve under the pure expectations theory are: . if the yield curve is upward sloping, short-term rates are expected to rise. . | if the curve is downward sloping, short-term rates are expected to fall. . | A flat yield curve implies that the market expects short-term rates to remain constant. . | . Local expectations theory . The local expectations theory preserves the risk-neutrality assumption only for short-term holding periods. . Liquidity preference theory . The liquidity preference theory of the term structure addresses the shortcomings of the pure expectations theory by proposing that forward rates reflects investors’ expectations of future spot rates, plus a liquidity premium to compensate investors for exposure to interest rate risk. The theory suggests that this liquidity premium is positively related to maturity. . The liquidity preference theory states that forward rates are upward-biased estimates of the market’s expectation of future rates because they include a liquidity premium. Therefore, a positive-sloping yield curve may indicate that either: (1) the market expects future interest rates to rise or (2) rates are expected to remain constant (or even fall), but the addition of the liquidity premium results in a positive slope. . 기대가 어떻든, liquidity premium이 있으니까 positive-sloping . Segmented markets theory . The shape of the yield curve is determined by the preferences of borrowers and lenders, which drives the balance between supply of and demand for loans of different maturities. This is called the segmented markets theory because the theory suggests that the yield at each maturity is determined independently of the yields at other maturities; we can think of each maturity to be essentially unrelated to other maturities. . The segmented markets theory supposes that various market participants only deal in securities of a particular maturity because they are prevented from operating at different maturities. . Preferred habitat theory . The preferred habitat theory also proposes that forward rates represent expected future spot rates plus a premium, but it does not support the view that this premium is directly related to maturity. . Premiums are related to supply and demand for funds at various maturities. . LOS 32.k: Describe modern term structure models and how they are used. . . Modern term structure models . Modern interest rate term structure models attempt to capture the statistical properties of interest rates movements and provide us with quantitatively precise descriptions of how interest rates will change. . Equilibrium term structure models. . . To-be model . Equilibrium term structure models attempt to describe changes in the term structure through the use of fundamental economic variables that drive interest rates. . CIR model, Vasicek model – single factor model . CIR model, Vasicek model 둘 다 drift term, random component로 이루어져있고, Vasicek model은 random component에서 interest rate의 차수가 0, CIR model은 차수가 0.5이다. . CIR model은 negative interest rate을 방지하고, 현재의 금리수준이 금리의 변동성에 영향을 주는 반면, Vasicek model은 negative interest rate이 가능하고, 현재의 금리수준이 금리의 변동성에 영향을 주지 않는다. . Drift term에서 a는 회귀상수, 장기평균으로 회귀하는 속도를 의미 . b는 장기평균, r은 연재 금리수준을 의미. . Arbitrage-free models . Arbitrage-free models of the term structure of interest rates begin with the assumption that bonds trading in the market are correctly priced, and the model is calibrated to value such bonds consistent with their market price. These models do not try to justify the current yield curve; rather, they take this curve as given. . As-is model . Calibration – parameter를 추정하는 과정 . Benchmark bond를 대상으로 설명하고 있음 . LOS 32.l: Explain how a bond’s exposure to each of the factors driving the yield curve can be measured and how these exposures can be used to manage yield curve risks. . Managing yield curve risks . Yield curve risk refers to risk to the value of a bond portfolio due to unexpected changes in the yield curve. . Effective duration . . . Effective duration은 yield curve가 parallel shift 할 때만 의미있음 . Non-parallel shift 하는 경우를 shaping risk라고 부름 . Key rate duration . . Key rate duration is the sensitivity of the value of a security (or a bond portfolio) to changes in a single pare rate, holding all other spot rates constant. In other words, key rate duration isolate price sensitivity to a change in the yield at a particular maturity only. . Every security or portfolio has a set of key rate durations-one for each key rate. . Key rate duration은 key rate으로 설정한 해당 금리의 변화에 따라 가격이 얼마나 변하는지 나타내는 민감도이다. 만약 해당 금리의 변화가 모두 같으면, Key rate duration들의 합은 effective duration과 같다. . Sensitivity to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements . . Level – a parallel increase or decrease of interest rates . Steepness – long-term interest rates increase while short-term rates decrease . Curvature – increasing curvature means short- and long-term interest rates increase while intermediate rates do not change. . LOS 32.m: Explain the maturity structure of yield volatilities and their effect on price volatility. . . Interest rate volatility becomes particularly important when securities have embedded options, which are especially sensitive to volatility. . Term structure of interest rate volatility – short-term interest rates are generally more volatile than are long-term rates . Volatility at the long-maturity end is thought to be associated with uncertainty regarding the real economy and inflation, while volatility at the short-maturity end reflects risks regarding monetary policy. . LOS 32.a: Explain what is meant by arbitrage-free valuation of a fixed-income instrument. . . The basic principle of the ‘law of one price’ in freely functioning markets drives this analytical framework. . Arbitrage-free valuation methods value securities such that no market participant can earn an arbitrage profit in a trade involving that security. . Two types – value additivity (when the value of whole differs from the sum of the values of parts) / dominance (when one asset trades at a lower price than another asset with identical characteristics) . . Reconstitution– Interest-only (IO) strip and principle-only (PO) strip to coupon bond . Stripping – coupon bond to IO strip and PO strip . LOS 33.b: Calculate the arbitrage-free value of an option-free, fixed-rate coupon bond. . While we can value option-free bonds with a simple spot rate curve, for bond with embedded options, the path and size of changes in future rates will affect the probability of the option being exercised and the underlying future cash flows. . LOS 33.c: Describe a binomial interest rate tree framework. . The binomial interest rate tree framework assumes that interest rates have an equal probability of taking one of two possible values in the next period (hence the term binomial). . The relationship among the set of rates associated with each individual nodal period is a function of the interest rate volatility assumed to generate the tree. Volatility estimates can be based on historical data or can be implied volatility derived from interest rate derivatives. . The binomial interest rate tree framework is a lognormal random walk model with two desirable properties: (1) higher volatility at higher rates and (2) non-negative interest rates. . Binomial tree . . . . LOS 33.d: Describe the backward induction valuation methodology and calculate the value of a fixed-income instrument given its cash flow at each node. . Because the probabilities of an up move and a down move are both 50%, the value of a bond at a given node in a binomial tree is the average of the present values of the two possible values from the next period. The appropriate discount rate is the forward rate associated with the node. . . . . LOS 33.e: Describe the process of calibrating a binomial interest rate tree to match a specific term structure. . Three rules . The interest rate tree should generate arbitrage-free values for the benchmark security. (fair pricing assumption) This means that the value of bonds produced by the interest rate tree must be equal to their market price, which excludes arbitrage opportunities. . | Adjacent forward rates (for the same period) are two standard deviations apart. . | The middle forward rate (or mid-point in case of even number of rates) in a period is approximately equal to the implied (from the benchmark spot rate curve) one-period forward rate for that period. . | LOS 33.f: Compare pricing using the zero-coupon yield curve with pricing using an arbitrage-free binomial lattice. . For bonds with embedded options, the future cash flows are uncertain as they depend on whether the embedded option will be in the money (and hence exercised). Hence, to value bonds with embedded options, we have to allow for rates to fluctuate. . LOS 33.g: Describe pathwise valuation in a binomial interest rate framework and calculate the value of a fixed-income instrument given its cash flows along each path. . For a binomial interest rate tree with n periods, there will be 2^(n-1) unique paths. . LOS 33.h: Describe a Monte Carlo forward-rate simulation and its application. . Path dependency . Unlike call risk, prepayment risk is affected not only by the level of interest rate at a particular point in time, but also by the path rates took to get there. . An important assumption of the binomial valuation process is that the value of the cash flows at a given point in time is independent of the path that interest rates followed up to that point. In other words, cash flows are not path dependent; cash flows at any node do not depend on the path rates took to get to that node. Because of path dependency of cash flows of mortgage-backed securities, the binomial tree backward induction process cannot be used to value such securities. We instead use the Monte Carlo simulation method to value mortgage-backed securities. . A monte Carlo forward-rate simulation involves randomly generating a large number of interest rate paths, using a model that incorporates a volatility assumption and assumed probability distribution. A key feature of the Monte Carlo method is that the underlying cash flows can be path dependent. . As with pathwise valuation, the value of the bond is the average of values from the various paths. The simulated paths should be calibrated so benchmark interest rate paths value benchmark securities at their market price (i.e. arbitrage-free valuation). The calibration process entails adding (subtracting) a constant to all rates when the value obtained from the simulated paths is too high (too low) relative to market prices. This calibration process results in a drift adjusted model. . A Monte Carlo simulation may impose upper and lower bounds on interest rates as part of the model generating the simulated paths. These bounds are based on the notion of mean reversion; rates tend to rise when they are too low and fall when they are too high. . . LOS 34.a: Describe fixed-income securities with embedded options. . Callable bonds give the issuer the option to call back the bond; the investor is short the call option. . Putable bonds allow the investor to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer prior to maturity. The investor is long the underlying put option. . Extendible bond allows the investor to extend the maturity of the bond. . Style . European style – whereby the option can only be exercised on a single day immediately after the lockout period . American style – whereby the option can be exercised at any time after the lockout period . Bermudan-style – whereby the option can be exercised at fixed dates after the lockout period . Complex options . Estate put . | Sinking fund bonds . | . . Los 34.b: Explain the relationships between the values of a callable or putable bond, the underlying option-free (straight) bond, and the embedded option. . Value of callable bond = value of straight bond – value of call option on the callable bond . Long callable bond = long straight bond + short call option on the callable bond . Value of putable bond = value of straight bond + value of put option on the putable bond . Long putable bond = long straight bond + long put option on the putable bond . . LOS 34.c: Describe how the arbitrage-free framework can be used to value a bond with embedded options. . LOS 34.f: Calculate the value of a callable or putable bond from an interest rate tree. . When valuing a callable bond, the value at any node where the bond is callable must be either the price at which the issuer will call the bond or the computed value if the bond is not called, whichever is lower. This is known as the call rule. Similarly, for a putable bond, the value used at any node corresponding to a put date must be either the price at which the investor will put the bond or the computed value if the bond is not put, whichever is higher. This is known as the put rule. . LOS 34.d: Explain how interest rate volatility affects the value of a callable or putable bond. . Option values are positively related to the volatility of their underlying. Accordingly, when interest rate volatility increases, the values of both call and put options increase. The value of a straight bond is affected by changes in the level of interest rates but is unaffected by changes in the volatility of interest rates. . When interest rate volatility increases, the value of a callable bond decreases and the value of a putable bond increases. . . . LOS 34.e: Explain how changes in the level and shape of the yield curve affect the value of a callable or putable bond. . Level of interest rates . As interest rates decline, the value of a callable bond rises less rapidly than the value of an otherwise-equivalent straight bond. As interest rates increase, the value of a putable bond falls less rapidly than the value of an otherwise-equivalent straight bond. . Call option on a bond value is inversely related to the level of interest rates, while put option on a bond value varies directly with the level of interest rates. . Shape of the yield curve . As an upward-sloping yield curve becomes flatter, the call option value increases. Put option value therefore declines as an upward-sloping yield curve flattens. . LOS 34.g: Explain the calculation and use of option-adjusted spreads. . The OAS is added to the tree after the adjustment for the embedded option. Hence the OAS is calculated after the option risk has been removed. – call/put rule로 인해 option risk가 제거됨. 그냥 OAS만큼 트리 전체를 올렸다 내렸다하는 것 . OAS is used by analysts in relative valuation; bonds with similar credit risk should have the same OAS. If the OAS for a bond is higher than the OAS of its peers, it is considered to be undervalued and hence an attractive investment. Conversely, bonds with low OAS relative to peers are considered to be overvalued. . . LOS 34.h: Explain how interest rate volatility affects option-adjusted spreads. . The OAS calculated varied depending on the volatility assumption used. When we use a higher estimate of volatility to value a callable bond, the calculated value of the call option increases, the calculated value of the straight bond is unaffected, and the computed value (not the market price) of the callable bond decreases (since the bondholder is short the option). Hence when the estimated (or assumed) volatility (of benchmark rates) used in a binomial tree is higher, the computed value of a callable bond will be lower-and therefore closer to its true market price. The constant spread that needs to be added to the benchmark rates to correctly price the bond (the OAS) is therefore lower. . As the assumed level of volatility used in an interest rate tree increases, the computed OAS (for a given market price) for a callable bond decreases. Similarly, the computed OAS of a putable bond increases as the assumed level of volatility in the binomial tree increases. . Assumed level of volatility Risk-free value OAS callable OAS putable       .   | calls | puts | callable | Putable |   |   | . High | high | high | low | High | low | High | . Low | low | low | high | low | high | Low | . . LOS 34.i: Calculate and interpret effective duration of a callable or putable bond. . . Given assumptions about benchmark interest rates, interest rate volatility, and any calls and/or puts, calculate the OAS for the issue using the current market price and the binomial model. . | Impose a small parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve by an amount of equal to delta y. . | Build a new binomial interest rate tree using the new yield curve. . | Add the OAS from step 1 to each of the one-year rates in the interest rate tree to get a modified tree. . | Compute estimated price if yield increases by delta y using this modified interest rate tree. . | Repeat step 2 through 5 using a parallel rate shift of delta y to obtain a value of estimated price if yield decreases by delta y using this modified interest rate tree. . | . . . . LOS 34.j: Compare effective durations of callable, putable, and straight bonds. . Both call and put options have the potential to reduce the life of a bond, so the duration of callable and putable bonds will be less than or equal to the duration of their straight counterparts. . Effective duration (callable, putable) &lt;= effective duration (straight) . | Effective duration of floater = time (in years) to next reset . | . An increase (decrease) in rates would decrease the effective duration of a putable (callable) bond. . LOS 34.k: Describe the use of one-sided durations and key rate durations to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options. . One-sided durations . For bonds with embedded options, one-sided durations-durations that apply only when interest rates rise (or, alternatively, only when rates fall)-are better at capturing interest rate sensitivity than simple effective duration. When the underlying option is at-the-money (or near-the-money), callable bonds will have lower one-sided down-duration than one-sided up-duration: the price change of a callable when rates fall is smaller than the price change for an equal increase in rates. Conversely, a near-the-money putable bond will have larger one-sided down-duration than one-sided up-duration. . Key rate duration . Key rate duration or partial durations capture the interest rate sensitivity of a bond to changes in yields (par rates) of specific benchmark maturities. Key rate duration is used to identify the interest rate risk from changes in the shape of the yield curve (shaping risk). . Generalization . If an option-free bond is trading at par, the bond’s maturity-matched rate is the only rate that affects the bond’s value. Its maturity key rate duration is the same as its effective duration, and all other rate durations are zero. . | For an option-free bond not trading at par, the maturity-matched rate is still the most important rate. . | A bond with low (or zero) coupon rate may have negative key rate durations for horizons other than the bond’s maturity. . | A callable bond with a low coupon rate is unlikely to be called; hence, the bond’s maturity-matched rate is the most critical rate. . | All else equal, higher coupon bonds are more likely to be called, and therefore the time-to-exercise rate will tend to dominate the time-to-maturity rate. . | Putable bonds with high coupon rates are unlikely to be put, and thus are most sensitive to their maturity-matched rates. . | All else equal, lower coupon bonds are more likely to be put, and therefore the time-to-exercise rate will tend to dominate the time-to-maturity rate. . | . . . . LOS 34.l: Compare effective convexities of callable, putable, and straight bonds. . When the underlying call option is near the money, its effective convexity turns negative. Putable bonds exhibit positive convexity throughout. . . . LOS 34.m: Calculate the value of a capped or floored floating-rate bond. . A capped floater effectively contains an issuer option that prevents the coupon rate from rising above a specified maximum rate known as the cap. . Value of a capped floater = value of a straight floater – value of the embedded cap . A floored floater has a coupon rate that will not fall below a specified minimum rate known as the floor. . Value of a floored floater = value of a straight floater + value of the embedded floor . We can use the standard backward induction methodology in a binomial interest rate tree to value a capped or floored floater. . . . LOS 34.n: Describe defining features of a convertible bond. . The owner of a convertible bond has the right to convert the bond into a fixed number of common shares of the issuer during a specified timeframe (conversion period) and at a fixed amount of money (conversion price). Convertibles allow investors to enjoy the upside on the issuer’s stock, although this comes at a cost of lower yield. The issuer of a convertible bond benefits from a lower borrowing cost, but existing shareholders may face dilution if the conversion option is exercised. . The conversion ratio is the number of common shares for which a convertible bond can be exchanged. Initial conversion ratio of 10 allows its holder to convert one $1000 par bond into 10 shares of common stock. . Conversion value = stock-equivalent value . Minimum value of CB = Max(conversion value, straight value) . Market conversion price = BEP stock price . The conversion price of the bond is $1000 / 10 shares = $100. . Offer documents may also provide a contingent put option in the event of any change-of-control events such as mergers. Alternatively, lower conversion price may be specified in the event of a change of control. The conversion ratio may also be adjusted upward if the company pays a dividend in excess of a specified threshold dividend. . . LOS 34.o: Calculate and interpret the components of a convertible bond’s value. . Conversion value = market price of stock * conversion ratio . The straight value, or investment value, of a convertible bond is the value of the bond if it were not convertible-the present value of the bond’s cash flows discounted at the return required on a comparable option-free issue. . Minimum value of a convertible bond = max(straight value, conversion value) . Market conversion price = market price of convertible bond / conversion ratio = BEP stock price . Market conversion premium per share = market conversion price – stock’s market price . Market conversion premium은 downside protection으로 인한 premium . Market conversion premium ratio = market conversion premium per share / market price of common stock . Premium over straight value = market price of convertible bond / straight value – 1 . All else equal, the greater the premium over straight value, the less attractive the convertible bond. . . LOS 34.p: Describe how a convertible bond is valued in an arbitrage-free framework. . Convertible, noncallable bond value = straight value + value of call option on stock . Callable convertible bond value = straight value of bond + value of call option on stock – value of call option on bond . Callable and putable convertible bond value = straight value of bond + value of call option on stock – value of call option on bond + value of put option on bond . LOS 34.q: Compare the risk-return characteristics of a convertible bond with the risk-return characteristics of a straight bond and of the underlying common stock. . Buying convertible bonds instead of stocks limits downside risk; the price floor set by the straight bond value provides this downside protection. The cost of the downside protection is reduced upside potential due to the conversion premium. Keep in mind though, that just like investing in nonconvertible bonds, convertible bond investors must be concerned with credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. . . The following comparisons can be made between ownership of the underlying stock and the risk-return characteristics of the convertible bond: . When the stock’s price falls, the returns on convertible bonds exceed those of the stock, because the convertible bond’s price has a floor equal to its straight bond value. . | When the stock’s price rises, the bond will underperform because of the conversion premium. This is the main drawback of investing in convertible bonds versus investing directly in the stock. . | If the stock’s price remains stable, the return on a convertible bond may exceed the stock return due to the coupon payments received from the bond, assuming no change in interest rates or credit risk of the issuer. . | . Sometimes the price of the common stock associated with a convertible issue is so low that is has little or no effect on the convertible’s market price, and the bond trades as though it is a straight bond. When this happens, the convertible security is referred to as a fixed-income equivalent or a busted convertible. . Bond analytics . Put-call parity . C – P = PV(forward price of the bond on exercise date) – PV(exercise price) | . | Option-free bond pricing . The valuation of option-free bonds should be independent of the assumed level of volatility used to generate the interest rate tree. | . | LOS 36.a: Describe credit default swap (CDS), single-name and index CDS, and the parameters that define a given CDS product. . A credit default swap (CDS) is essentially an insurance contract. . Protection buyer = long credit risk = short credit . Protection seller = short credit risk = long credit . To obtain this coverage, the protection buyer pays the seller a premium called the CDS premium to the protection seller. The contract is written on a face value of protection called the notional principal. . Even though the CDS spread should be based on the underlying credit risk of the reference obligation, standardization in the market has led to a fixed coupon on CDS product: 1% for investment-grade securities and 5% for high-yield securities. Hence, the coupon rate on the CDS and the actual credit spread may be different. The present value of the difference between the standardization coupon rate and the credit spread on the reference obligation is paid upgront by one of the parties to the contract. . For a protection buyer, a CDS has some of the characteristics of a put option-when the underlying performs poorly, the holder of the put option has a right to exercise the option. . The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the unofficial governing body of the industry, publishes standardized contract terms and conventions in the ISDA Master Agreement to facilitate smooth functioning of the CDS market. . . . Single-name CDS . In the case of a single-name CDS, the reference obligation is the fixed-income security on which the swap is written, usually a senior unsecured obligation (in the case of a senior CDS). The issuer of the reference obligation is called the reference entity. The CDS pays off not only when the reference entity defaults on any other issue that is ranked pari passu or higher. The CDS payoff is based on the market value of the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond that has the same seniority as the reference obligation. . Contract에 따라 다르지만, credit event의 reference entity . Coverage reference obligation 기준은 same or higher, payoff는 CTD bond (same rank) . Index CDS . An index CDS covers multiple issuers. . The pricing of an index CDS is dependent on the correlation of default (credit correlation) among the entities in the index. The higher the correlation of default among index constituents, the higher the spread on the index CDS. . LOS 36.b: Describe credit event and settlement protocols with respect to CDS. . Credit event . Bankruptcy on the refence entity . | Failure to pay all the outstanding debts . | Restructuring . | Cross default . | Obligation acceleration . | Moratorium . | Repudiation . | A 15-member group of the ISDA called the Determinations Committee (DC) declares when a credit event has occurred. . When there is a credit event, the swap will be settled in cash or by physical delivery. With physical delivery, the protection seller receives the reference obligation and pays the protection buyer the notional amount. . In the case of a cash settlement, the payout amount is the payout ratio times the notional principal. The payout ratio depends on the recovery rate. . Payout amount = payout ratio * notional principal . Payout ratio = 1 – recovery rate (%) . LOS 36.c: Explain the principles underlying, and factors that influence, the market’s pricing of CDS. . The factors that influence the pricing of CDS include the 1) probability of default, 2) loss given default. The CDS spread is higher for higher probability of default and for higher loss given default. . Probability of default is the likelihood of default by the reference entity in a given year. However, because the CDS typically covers a multi-year horizon, the probability of default is not constant; the probability of default usually increases over time. For a single-name CDS, when a default occurs, a payment is made by the protection seller to the protection buyer and the CDS ceases to exist. Hence, in the context of a CDS, the probability of default in any given year assumes that no default has occurred in the preceding years. We call the probability of default given that it has not already occurred the conditional probability of default or hazard rate. . Loss given default is the expected amount of loss in the event that a default occurs. . Expected loss at t = hazard rate at t * loss given default . Loss given default (%) = 1 – recovery rate . . . The cash payments made by the protection buyer on the CDS cease when there is a default. Hence, the expected value of the coupon payments also depends on the hazard rate. . The payments made by the protection buyer to the seller are the premium leg. These contingent payments make up the protection leg. . The difference between the present value of the premium leg and the present value of the protection leg determines the upfront payment. . Upfront payment (by protection buyer) = PV(protection leg) – PV(premium leg) . We can appropriate the upfront premium as the difference between the CDS spread and the CDS coupon rate, multiplied by the duration of the CDS. . Upfront premium % = (CDS spread – CDS coupon) * duration . CDS spread = upfront premium % / duration + CDS coupon . Price of CDS (per $100 notional) = $100 – upfront premium (%) . Valuation after inception of CDS . At inception of a CDS, the CDS spread (and the upfront premium) is computed based on the credit quality of the reference entity. After inception, the credit quality of the reference entity (or the credit risk premium in the overall market) may change. This will lead to the underlying CDS having a nonzero value. . The change in value of a CDS after inception can be approximated by the change in spread multiplied by the duration of the CDS. . Profit for protection buyer = change in spread * duration * notional principal . Profit for protection buyer (%) = change in spread (%) * duration . The protection buyer (or seller) can unwind an existing CDS exposure (prior to expiration or default) by entering into an offsetting transaction. This process of capturing value from an in-the-money CDS exposure is called monetizing the gain. . . . LOS 36.d: Describe the use of CDS to manage credit exposures and to express views regarding changes in shape and / or level of the credit curve. . Credit curve . The credit curve is the relationship between credit spreads for different bonds issued by an entity, and the bonds’ maturities. The credit curve is similar to the term structure of interest rates. If the longer maturity bonds have a higher credit spread compared to shorter maturity bonds, the credit curve will be upward sloping. . Naked CDS . CDS can be used to manage credit exposures of a bond portfolio. In a naked CDS, an investor with no underlying exposure purchases protection in the CDS market. . Long/Short trade . In a long / short trade, an investor purchases protection on one reference entity while simultaneously selling protection on another (often related) reference entity. The investor is betting that the difference in credit spreads between the two reference entities will change to the investor’s advantage. This is similar to going long (protection seller exposure) in one reference entity bond and simultaneously going short (protection buyer exposure) in the other reference entity bond. . . Curve trade . A curve trade is a type of long/short trade where the investor is buying and selling protection on the same reference entity but with a different maturity. . An investor concerned about the credit risk of an issuer in the near term while being more confident of the long-term prospects of the issuer might buy protection in the short-term CDS and offset the premium cost by selling protection in the long-term CDS. Conversely, an investor who is bearish about the reference entity’s prospects in the short term will enter into a curve-flattening trade. . . LOS 36.e: Describe the use of CDS to take advantage of valuation disparities among separate markets, such as bonds, loans, equities, and equity0linked instruments. . Earning arbitrage profits is another motivation for trading in the CDS market. Difference in pricing between asset and derivative markets, or differences in pricing of different products in the market, may offer potential arbitrage profits. . Basis trade . A basis trade is an attempt to exploit the difference in credit spreads between bond markets and the CDS market. . Another arbitrage transaction involves buying and selling debt instruments issued by the same entity based on which instruments the CDS market suggests to be undervalued or overvalued. . . LBO . In a leveraged buyout (LBO), the firm will issue a great amount of debt in order to repurchase all of the company’s publicly traded equity. This additional debt will increase the CDS spread because default is now more likely. An investor who anticipates an LBO might purchase both the stock and CDS protection both of which will increase in value when the LBO eventually occurs. . Index CDS . In the case of an index CDS, the value of the index should be equal to the sum of the values of the index components. An arbitrage transaction is possible if the credit risk of the index constituents is priced differently than the index CDS spread. . CDO . Collateralized debt obligation (CDO) are claims against a portfolio of debt securities. A synthetic CDO has similar credit risk exposure to that of a cash CDO but is assembled using CDS rather than debt securities. If the synthetic CDO can be created at a cost lower than that of the cash CDO, investors can buy the synthetic CDO and sell the cash CDO, engaging in a profitable arbitrage. . . LOS 35.a: Explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment. . Expected exposure is the amount of money a bond investor in a credit risky bond stands to lose at a point in time before any recovery is factored in. A bond’s expected exposure changes over time. . Recovery rate is the percentage recovered in the event of a default. . Loss given default (LGD) is equal to loss severity multiplied by exposure. . Probability of default is the likelihood of default occurring a given year. The initial probability of default is also known as the hazard rate. The probability of default in each subsequent year is calculated as the conditional probability of default given that default has previously not occurred. . Probability of survival at t = (1 – hazard rate)^t if hazard rate is constant . Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is the sum of the present value of the expected loss for each period. CVA is the monetary value of the credit risk in present value terms; it is the difference in value between a risk-free bond and an otherwise identical risky bond. . CVA = price of risk-free bond – price of risky bond . . . . . Risk neutral probability of default . Risk neutral probability of default, which is the probability of default implied in the current market price. . We can also calculate the implied recovery rate in the market price given the probability of default. In general, given the market price (and hence the credit spread), the estimated risk neutral probabilities of default and recovery rates are positively correlated. . Relative credit risk analysis . While comparing the credit risk of several bonds, the metric that combines the probability of default as well as loss severity is the expected loss. Everything else constant, for a given period, the higher the expected loss, the higher the credit risk. . LOS 35.b: Explain credit scores and credit ratings. . Credit scoring is used for small businesses and individuals. A higher credit score indicates better credit quality. . Credit ratings are issued for corporate debt, asset-backed securities, and government and quasi-government debt. The issuer rating for a company is typically for its senior unsecured debt. Ratings on other classes of debt by the same issuer may be notched. Notching is the practice of lowering the rating by one or more levels for more subordinated debt of the issuer. Notching accounts for LGD difference between classes of debt by the same issuer (higher LGD for issues with lower seniority). . . LOS 35.c: Calculate the expected return on a bond given transition in its credit rating. . Credit migration (i.e., change in rating) . . LOS 35.d: Explain structural and reduced-form models of corporate credit risk, including assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses. . Structural models . Structural models of corporate credit risk are based on the structure of a company’s balance sheet and rely on insights provided by option pricing theory. . Option analogy . Consider a hypothetical company with assets that are financed by equity and a single issue of zero-coupon debt. . Due to the limited liability nature of corporate equity, the shareholders effectively have a call option on the company’s assets with a strike price equal to the face value of debt. . An alternate, but related interpretation considers equity investors as long the net assets of the company and long a put option, allowing them to seel the assets at an exercise price of X. default is then synonymous to exercising the put opition. . Under the put option analogy, the investors in risky debt can be constructed to have a long position in risk-free debt and a short position in that put option. . Value of risky debt = value of risk-free debt – value of put option . Value of risky debt = value of risk-free debt – CVA . The value of the put option = CVA . If the value of assets falls below the default barrier X, the company defaults. The probability of default is indicated by the region in the left tail below the default barrier of X. . Advantages of structural models . Structural models provide an economic rationale for default and explain why default occurs. . | Structural models utilize option pricing models to value risky debt. . | . Disadvantages of structural models . Because structural models assume a simple balance sheet structure, complex balance sheets cannot be modeled. Additionally, when companies have off-balance sheet debt, the default barrier under structural models (X) would be inaccurate and hence the estimate outputs of the model will be inaccurate. . | One of the key assumptions of the structural model is that the assets of the company are traded in the market. This restrictive assumption makes the structural model impractical. . | . . . . Reduced form models . Reduced form (RF) models do not rely on the structure of a company’s balance sheet and therefore do not assume that the assets of the company trade. Unlike the structural model, reduce form models do not explain why default occurs. Instead, they statistically model when default occurs. Default under the RF model is a randomly occurring exogenous variable. . A key input into the RF model is the default intensity, which is the probability of default over the next (small) time period. Default intensity can be estimated using regression models. . Advantages of reduced form models . RF models do not assume that the assets of a company trade . | Default intensity is allowed to vary as company fundamentals changes, as well as when the state of the economy changes. . | . Disadvantages of reduced form models . RF models do not explain why default occurs. . | Under RF models, default is treated as a random event, but in reality, default is rarely a surprise. . | . Los 35.e: Calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters. . Credit spread on a risky bond = YTM of risky bond – YTM of benchmark . Value given no default (VND) is calculated using the risk-free rate to value the risky bond. . We use our standard backward induction process to value a risky bond given the benchmark rate tree. . Once the expected exposure for each period is calculated, given an estimated unconditional probability of default and a recovery rate, we use the same method discussed earlier to calculate the CVA for the bond. . . LOS 35.f: Interpret changes in a credit spread. . A benchmark yield should be equal to the real risk-free rate plus expected inflation as well as a risk-premium for uncertainty in future inflation. Credit spreads include compensation for default, liquidity, and taxation risks relative to the benchmark. Adjustment to the price for all these risk factors together is known as the XVA. Default risk component is the most important and most-commonly-used in practice. . Credit spreads change as investor perceptions about the future probability of default and recovery rates change. These perceptions depend on expectations about the state of the economy. Expectations of impending recessions lead to expectations of higher defaults and lower recovery rates. . LOS 35.g: Explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads. . The term structure of credit spread shows the relationship between credit spreads and maturity. . The credit spread is inversely related to the recovery rate and positively related to the probability of default. However, oftentimes a maturity-matched, liquid benchmark security is not available. In such cases, interpolation from available benchmark securities is used. When such data is not easily available, or when benchmark bonds are thinly traded, a spread relative to a swap fixed rate (corresponding to the maturity of the bond) may be used. . To create a spread curve, all of the bonds whose spreads are used should have similar credit characteristics. . Key determinants of the shape of the credit spread curve include expectations about future recovery rates and default probabilities. If default probabilities are expected to be higher or recovery rates lower in the future, the credit curve would be expected to be positively sloped. Flat credit curves indicates stable expectations over time. . . Determinants of term structure of credit spreads . Credit quality – lower-rated sectors tend to have steeper spread curves, reflecting greater uncertainty as well as greater sensitivity to the business cycle. . | Financial conditions – spreads narrow during economic expansions and widen during cyclical downturns. During boom times, benchmark yields tend to be higher while credit spreads tend to be narrower. . | Market demand and supply – recall that a credit spread includes a premium for lack of liquidity. Hence, less liquid maturities would show higher spreads (even if the expectations for that time period are stable). Due to low liquidity in most corporate issues, the credit curves are most heavily influenced by more heavily traded bonds. . | Equity market volatility – increases in equity volatility therefore tend to widen spreads and influence the shape of the credit spread curve. . | LOS 35.h: Compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt to the credit analysis of corporate debt. . Components of credit analysis of secured debt . Collateral pool . Credit analysis of structured, securitized debt begins with the collateral pool. Homogeneity of a pool refers to the similarity of the assets within the collateral pool. Granularity refers to the transparency of assets within the pool. A highly granular pool would have hundreds of clearly defined loans, allowing for use of summary statistics as opposed to investigating each borrower. . Short-term granular and homogeneous structured finance vehicles are evaluated using a statistical-based approach. Medium-term granular and homogeneous obligations are evaluated using a portfolio-based approach because the portfolio composition varies over time. (segmentation해서 analysis) discrete and non-granular portfolios have to be evaluated at the individual loan level. . Servicer quality . Servicer quality is important to evaluate the ability of the servicer to manage the origination and servicing of the collateral pool. . Structure . Structure determines the tranching or other management of credit and other risks in a collateral pool. . Internal / external credit enhancement . A special structure is the case of covered bond. – loan을 true sale하지 않고, 담보로 structuring, 해당 loan들은 balance sheet에서 segregated . Issued by a financial institution, covered bonds are senior, secured bonds backed by a collateral pool as well as by the issuer. .",

An ownership interests between 20% and 50% is typically a noncontrolling investment; however, the investor can usually significantly influence the investee’s business operations. . Under the equity method, the initial investment is recorded at cost and reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent asset. . In subsequent periods, the proportionate share of the investee’s earnings increases the investment account on the investor’s balance sheet and is recognized in the investor’s income statement. Dividends received from the investee are treated as a return of capital and thus, reduce the investment amount. Dividends received from the investee are not recognized in the investor’s income statement. . If the investee reports a loss, the investor’s proportionate share of the loss reduces the investment account and also lower earnings in the investor’s income statement. If the investee’s losses reduce the investment account to zero, the investor usually discontinues use of the equity method. . 손실을 보다가 balance sheet의 investment 자산을 다 까먹으면 더 이상 손실을 인식하지 않음.

Fair MV 변화 없을 경우, the equity method usually results in higher earnings as compared to the accounting methods used for minority passive investments. . The investor simply reports its proportionate share of the investee’s equity in one line on the balance sheet. By ignoring the investee’s debt, leverage is lower. In addition, the margin ratios are higher since the investee’s revenues are ignored. . The proportionate share of the investee’s earnings is recognized in the investor’s income statement, but the earnings may not be available to the investor in the form of cash flow (dividends). That is, the investee’s earnings may be permanently reinvested. . Business combinations . Ownership 50% 이상 . Consolidation by acquisition method . 피투자사의 자산과 부채를 전부 투자자의 balance sheet에 엎는다. 그리고 나서 equity를 계산하고, NCI (non-controlling interest)라는 항목으로 보유하지 않은 지분을 equity에 표시한다. . | Income statement에서도 revenue와 expense를 모두 엎어온다. 그리고 나서 NI산출 전에 minority interest라는 항목으로 보유하지 않은 지분만큼의 earnings를 빼준다. . | . 100% Acquisition . . . 80% Acquisition . . Proportionate consolidation . . Goodwill . Under the acquisition method, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired firm on the basis of fair value. Any remainder is reported on the balance sheet as goodwill. Goodwill is said to be an unidentifiable asset that cannot be separated from the business. . 구매한 금액을 피투자사의 balance sheet에서 pro forma하게 나눠서 allocation하는데, 이 때 identifiable asset에만 allocation을 해야한다. 즉, 피투자사가 goodwill과 같이 unidentifiable asset을 가지고 있으면 해당 부분에는 allocation하지 않는다. Allocation을 다 하고 산출된 fair value of equity를 활용해서 purchase price – fair value of equity = goodwill을 계산한다. | . The full goodwill method results in higher total assets and higher total equity than the partial goodwill method. Thus, ROA and ROE will be lower if the full goodwill method is used. . Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment occurs when the carrying value exceed the fair value. Because of its inseparability, goodwill is valued at the reporting unit level. . . US GAAP . Goodwill is the amount by which the fair value of the subsidiary is greater than the fair value of the subsidiary’s identifiable net assets (full goodwill). . Goodwill = fair value of 피투자사 - 피투자사의 fair value of equity . | 둘은 엄연히 다르며, fair value of equity는 투자자가 바라보는 피투자사의 fair value of asset and liability를 통해 산출된 값을 의미하며, fair value of 피투자사는 투자자가 지불한 투자사의 equity의 market price로 이해하면 된다. 즉, purchase price. . | . US GAAP는 full goodwill만 허용한다. . Full goodwill은 goodwill을 산출할 때 내가 보유하지 않은 지분까지 전부 포함해서 산출하는 개념을 의미한다. 즉, NCI (non-controlling interest)도 fair value 평가를 해주는 개념. | . Goodwill impairment potentially involves two steps. . The carrying value of the reporting unit (including the good will) &gt; the fair value of the reporting unit . | Impairment loss = difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill. . The impairment loss is recognized in the income statement as a part of continuing operations. | . | The implied fair value of the goodwill is calculated in the same manner as goodwill at the acquisition date. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities as if they were acquired on the impairment measurement date. Any excess is considered the implied fair value of the goodwill. . IFRS . Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquiring company’s proportion of the acquired company’s identifiable net assets (partial goodwill). However, IFRS permits the use of the full goodwill approach also. . Testing for impairment involves a single step approach. . The carrying amount of the cash generating unit (where the goodwill is assigned) &gt; the recoverable amount -&gt; impairment loss is recognized. | Recoverable amount = max(net selling price, value in use) | . Impairment of goodwill . . . . Under IFRS and US GAAP, recovery is not allowed. . Bargain purchase . In rare cases, acquisition purchase price is less than the fair value of net assets acquired. Both IFRS and US GAAP requires that the difference between fair value of net assets and purchase price be recognized as a gain in the income statement. . . Joint ventures . Investment in associates로 취급. . 개정됐으나 시험목적 상 In rare cases, IFRS and US GAAP allow proportionate consolidation as opposed to the equity method. Proportionate consolidation is similar to a business acquisition, except the investor (venturer) only reports the proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the joint ventures. Since only the proportionate share is reported, no minority owners’ interest is necessary. . Joint venture is an entity in which control is shared by two or more investors. . Special purpose and variable interest entities . A SPE is a legal structure created to isolate certain assets and liabilities of the sponsor. SPEs are often structured such that the sponsor company has control over the SPE’s finances or operating activities while third parties have controlling interest in the SPE’s equity. . Consolidation, a VIE is an entity that has one or both of the following characteristics: .

LOS 14.a: Describe the types of post-employment benefit plan and implications for financial reports. . . DC (Defined Contribution) . The firm contributes a certain sum each period to the employee’s retirement account. The firm’s contribution can be based on any number of factors including years of service, the employee’s age, compensation, profitability, or even a percentage of the employee’s contribution. In any event, the firm makes no promise to the employee regarding the future value of the plan assets. The investment decisions are left to the employee, who assumes all of the investment risk. . Pension expense is simply equal to the employer’s contribution. There is no future obligation to report on the balance sheet. . 회사는 지불한 cash paid = pension expense. 그러므로 no obligation if fully funded. . DB (Defined Benefit) . . . The firm promises to make periodic payments to the employee after retirement. . Since the employee’s future benefit is defined, the employer assumes the investment risk. . 굉장히 많은 assumption이 들어감. .

The difference in the benefit obligation and the plan assets . Funded Status = Plan Asset – PBO . Plan Asset &gt; PBO: Over funded . Plan Asset &lt; PBO: Under Funded . Other post-employment benefits . Health care benefits . Similar to DB pension plan . Future benefit is defined today but is based on a number of unknown variables. The employer must forecast health care costs that are expected once the employee retires. . Pension plans are typically funded at some level, while other post-employment benefit plans are usually unfunded. In the case of an unfunded plan, the employer recognizes expense in the income statement as the benefits are earned; however, the employer’s cash flow is not affected until the benefits are actually paid to the employee. . LOS 14.b: Explain and calculate measures of a defined benefit pension obligation (i.e., present value of the defined benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation) and net pension liability (or asset). . . . . . Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) – US GAAP . Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation (PVDBO) – IFRS . All future pension benefits earned to date, based on expected future salary increases. . Annual Unit Credit (benefit) = value at retirement / number of years of service . Current Service Cost is the present value of benefits earned by the employees during the current period. Service cost includes an estimate of compensation growth (future salary increase) if the pension benefits are based on future compensation. . Interest cost is the increase in the obligation due to the passage of time. Benefit obligations are discounted obligations; thus, interest accrues on the obligation each period. . Interest cost = pension obligation at the beginning of the period * discount rate . Past (prior) service costs are retroactive benefits awarded to employees when a plan is initiated or amended. Under IFRS, past service costs are expensed immediately. Under US GAAP, past service costs are amortized over the average service life of employees. . Pension policy의 변경 – 소급적용하면 비용을 더 잡아줘야 함 .

Current service cost is immediately recognized in the income statement. . Interest Cost . Interest cost = Beginning PBO * Discount Rate . Interest Cost is immediately recognized as a component of pension expense. . Expected Return on Plan Assets . The return on the plan assets has no effect on the PBO. Expected return instead of actual return) on plan assets is used for the computation of reported pensions expense. The difference in the expected return and the actual return is combined with other items related to changes in actuarial assumptions into the “actuarial gains and losses” account. The difference in the expected return and the actual return is combined with other items related to changes in actuarial assumptions into the “actuarial gains and losses” account. . Net Interest Expense/Income (Under IFRS) . Net Interest Expense (Income) = Beginning Funded Status * Discount Rate . Under IFRS, the expected rate of return on plan assets is implicitly assumed to be the same as the discount rate used for computation of PBO and a net interest expense/income is reported. . Actuarial Gains and Losses . Actuarial gains/losses as changes in PBO due to changes in actuarial assumptions. . Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are not amortized. . Under US GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach. . Corridor Approach (US GAAP only) . Once the beginning balance of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the beginning PBO or plan assets, amortization is required. The excess amount over the “corridor” is amortized as a component of periodic pension cost in P &amp;L over the remaining service life of the employees. . Past (prior) Service Cost . When a firm adopts or amends its pension plan, the PBO is immediately increased. . Under US GAAP, it is reported as a part of other comprehensive income and amortized over the remaining service life of the affected employee. . Under IFRS, the past service costs are recognized in periodic pension cost in P &amp;L immediately. . . Component US GAAP IFRS . Current service cost | IS | IS | .

Presentation . . Under US GAAP, all components of periodic pension cost that are reported in the income statement are aggregated and presented as a single line item. . Under IFRS, components may be presented separately. . Both US GAAP and IFRS require disclosure of total periodic pension cost in the notes to financial statements. . LOS 14.d: Explain and calculate the effect of a defined benefit plan’s assumptions on the defined benefit obligation and periodic pension cost. . The firm discloses three assumptions used in its pension calculation. . Discount rate . | Rate of compensation growth . | Expected return on plan assets . | Effect on Increase discount rate Decrease rate of compensation growth Increase expected rate of return . Balance sheet liability | Decrease | Decrease | No effect | . Total periodic pension cost | Decrease* | Decrease | No effect | . Periodic pension cost in P &amp;L | Decrease* | Decrease | Decrease** | . *For mature plans, a higher discount rate might increase interest costs. In rare cases, interest cost will increase by enough to offset the decrease in the current service cost, and periodic pension cost will increase. . **Under US GAAP only. . Ultimate health care trend rate . . The assumptions are similar for other post-employment benefits except the compensation growth rate is replaced by a health care inflation rate. Generally, the presumption is the inflation rate will taper off and eventually become constant. This constant rate is known as the ultimate health care trend rate. . All else equal, firms can reduce the post-employment benefit obligation and periodic expense by decreasing the near term health care inflation rate, by decreasing the ultimate health care trend rate, or by reducing the time needed to reach the ultimate health care trend rate. . Asset allocation . Under US GAAP, the assumed expected rate of return should be consistent with plan’s asset allocation. . Los 14.e: Explain and calculate how adjusting for items of pension and other post-employment benefits that are reported in the notes to the financial statements affects financial statements and ratios. . . . Gross vs. net pension assets/liabilities . | Difference in assumptions used . | Difference between IFRS and US GAAP in recognizing total periodic pension cost (in income statement vs. OCI) . | Differences due to classification in the income statement . | LOS 14.f: Interpret pension plan not disclosures including cash flow related information. . If the firm’s contributions exceed its TPPC, the difference can be viewed as a reduction in the overall pension obligation, similar to an excess principal payment on a loan. Conversely, if TPPC exceeds the contributions, the difference can be viewed as a source of borrowing. . LOS 14.g: Explain issues associated with accounting for shared-based compensation. . Share-based Compensation . . Stock options . Outright share grants . They have the advantages of serving to motivate and retain employees as well as being a way to reward employees with no additional outlay of cash. . If the shares are not publicly traded, an estimate of value must be used for stock grants. Unless the market price of the options is available, the value of stock options must be estimated using an options valuation model. . The compensation expense recorded is spread over the period of time from the grant date until the date on which they can be sold by the employee. The overall principle here is the compensation expense should be spread over the period for which they reward the employee, referred to as the service period. . LOS 14.h: Explain how accounting for stock grants and stock options affects financial statements, and the importance of companies’ assumptions in valuing these grants and options. . Stock option . . . Additional Paid-In Capital에 Stock Option 명목으로 올리고, Income statement에 compensation expense로 태우고, Retained Earnings가 낮아지면서 대차가 맞아지는 과정 . 실제 exercise되면 CFF를 통해 현금이 들어오고, 대차를 맞춤 . Compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options on the grand date based on the number of options that are expected to vest. The vesting date is the first date the employee can actually exercise the options. The compensation expense is allocated in the income statement over the service period. . Recognition of compensation expense will decrease net income and retained earnings; however, paid-in capital is increased by an identical amount. This results in no change to total equity. . Option pricing models . Exercise price . | Stock price at the grant date . | Expected term . | Expected volatility . | Expected dividends . | Risk-free rate . | Lower volatility, a shorter term or a lower risk-free rate, will typically decrease the estimated fair value of the options, decreasing compensation expense. A higher expected dividend yield will also decrease the estimated fair value and compensation expense. . Stock appreciation rights . . 현금만큼 지급하는 개념이라 Liability에 태우고, 실제 지급할 때 cash가 나가면서 liability가 사라짐 . The difference between a stock appreciation right and an option is the form of payment. A stock appreciation award gives the employee the right to receive compensation based on the increase in the price of the firm’s stock over a predetermined amount. With stock appreciation rights, employees have limited downside risk and unlimited upside potential. Also, since no shares are actually issued, there is no dilution to existing shareholders. A disadvantage of stock appreciation rights is that they require current period cash outlay. . Stock grants . Compensation expense for stock granted to an employee is based on the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The compensation expense is allocated over the employee’s service period. . Restricted stock, performance stock . With restricted stock, the transferred stock cannot be sold by the employee until vesting has occurred. . Performance stock is contingent on meeting performance goals, such as accounting earnings or other financial reporting metrics like return on assets or return on equity. . LOS 15.a: Distinguish among presentation (reporting) currency, functional currency, and local currency.’ . Local currency . Functional currency – determined by management, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. It is usually the currency in which the entity generates and expends cash. The functional currency can be the local currency or some other currency. . Presentation (reporting) currency – the parent company prepares its financial statements. . . . . LOS 15.b: Describe foreign currency transaction exposure, including accounting for and disclosures about foreign currency transaction gains and losses. . IFRS requires disclosure of the “amount of exchange rate differences recognized in profit or loss” while US GAAP requires disclosure of “the aggregate transaction gain or loss included in determining net income for the period.” Obviously, the comparability of operating margins between entities would be diminished if the compared entities used different methods. . LOS 15.c: Analyze how changes in exchange rates affect the translated sales of the subsidiary and parent company. . LOS 15.d: Compare the current rate method and the temporal method, evaluate how each affects the parent company’s balance sheet and income statement, and determine which method is appropriate in various scenarios. . . Remeasurement involves converting the local currency into functional currency using the temporal method. . LC != FC = PC . Translation involves converting the functional currency into the parent’s presentation (reporting) currency using the current rate method. The current rate method is also known as the all-current method. . LC = FC != PC . . Current rate method . . All income statement accounts are translated at the average rate. . All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate except for common stock, which is translated at the historical (actual) rate that applied when the stock was issued. . Dividends are translated at the rate that applied when they were declared. . Translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders’ equity as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA). . The CTA is simply a “plug” figure that forces the basic accounting equation (A = L + E) to balance. . . Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using the current exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities are fixed in the amount of currency to be received or paid and include: cash, receivables, payables, and short-term and long-term debt. . All other assets and liabilities are considered nonmonetary and are remeasured at the historical (actual) rate. The most common nonmonetary assets include inventory, fixed assets, and intangible assets. . Just life the current rate method, common stock and dividends paid are remeasured at the historical (actual) rate. . Expenses related to nonmonetary assets such as COGS, depreciation expense, and amortization expense are remeasured based on the historical rates prevailing at the time of purchase. . Remeasurement gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. This results in more volatile net income as compared to the current rate method whereby the translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders’ equity. . Recall the ending inventory under FIFO consists of the costs from the most recently purchased goods. Thus, FIFO ending inventory is remeasured based on more recent exchange rates. On the other hand, FIFO COGS consists of costs that are older; thus, the exchange rates used to remeasure COGS are older. . Under LIFO, ending inventory consists of older costs; thus, the inventory is remeasured at older exchange rates. LIFO COGS, however, consists of costs from the most recently purchased goods; thus, COGS is remeasured based on more recent exchange rates. .   Local currency   . Exposure | appreciating | depreciating | . Current rate method |   |   | . Net assets | gain | Loss | . Net liabilities | loss | Gain | . Temporal method |   |   | .

Net income | Mixed | Average rate | . Exposure | Net monetary assets | Net assets | . Exchange rate gain or loss | Income statement | Equity | . Under the temporal method, firms can eliminate their exposure to changing exchange rates by balancing monetary assets and monetary liabilities. When balanced, no gain or loss is recognized. .

LOS 15.g: Analyze how alternative translation methods for subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies affect financial statements and ratios. . . Under US GAAP, a hyperinflationary environment is one where cumulative inflation exceeds 100% over a 3-year period. Assuming compounding, an annual inflation rate of more than 26% over three years will result in cumulative inflation over 100%. When hyperinflation is present, use the temporal method. . US GAAP는 단순하게 바로 temporal method 사용 . Under IFRS, the IASB does not specifically define hyperinflation; however, cumulative inflation of over 100% in a 3-year period is one indication that hyperinflation exists. .

LOS 16.b: Describe key aspects of financial regulations of financial institutions. . Basel III . The three pillars of the Basel III framework are the maintenance of minimum levels of capital, liquidity, and stable funding. . Minimum required capital for a bank is based on the risk of the bank’s assets. The riskier a bank’s assets are, the higher its required capital. . | Basel III specifies that a bank should hold enough liquid assets to meet demands under a 30-day liquidity stress scenario. . | The Basel III framework requires stable funding relative to a bank’s liquidity needs over a one-year time horizon. Stability in funding is proportional to the tenor of the bank’s deposits; longer-term deposits are more stable than shorter-term deposits. Stability also depends on the type of deposit. . | . Global organizations . Financial Stability Board . | International Association of Deposit Insurers – seeks to improve the effectiveness of deposit insurance systems. . | International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) – seeks to promote fair and efficient security markets. . | International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) – seeks to improve supervision of the insurance industry. . | LOS 16.c: Explain the CAMELS (capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity) approach to analyzing a bank, including key ratios and its limitations. . Capital Adequacy . . Capital adequacy is based on risk-weighted assets (RWA); more risky assets require a higher level of capital. . Basel III defines a bank’s capital in a tiered, hierarchical approach: . Tier 1 capital: . Common equity Tier 1 capital (the most important component): Common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and OCI less intangibles and deferred tax assets. . | Other Tier 1 capital: subordinated instruments with no specified maturity and no contractual dividends (e.g., preferred stock with discretionary dividends). . | | Tier 2 capital: subordinated instruments with original (i.e., when issued) maturity of more than five years. . | Individual jurisdictions specify the minimum capital requirements. Basel III guidelines specify a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 4.5% of RWA, minimum total Tier 1 capital of 6% of RWA, and minimum total capital of 8% of RWA. . . Asset Quality . . Evaluation of asset quality includes analysis of current and potential credit risk associated with the bank’s assets. . Bank assets include loans (the largest component) and investments in securities. While loans are generally carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost (net of allowances), the accounting treatment for investments in securities differs between US GAAP and IFRS. . Credit Risk Analysis . Credit risk is present in debt securities that the bank invests in, loans the bank makes, as well as in the bank’s off-balance-sheet liabilities. Analyzing the credit quality of a bank’s assets can provide an analyst key insights into the bank’s solvency and future profitability. . Key loans . Past due but not yet impaired . | Impaired . | Seriously impaired . | . Loan Loss Provisions . The credit quality of loans and loss provisions are critical in evaluating the bank’s financial position and performance. Allowance for loan losses is a contra asset account to loans and is the result of provision for loan losses, an expense subject to management discretion. Analysts need to evaluate the bank’s policy of setting aside adequate provisions relative to actual loan performance. Actual losses (net of recoveries) are then written off against these provisions. . Ratios . Ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans. . | Ratio of allowance for loan losses to net loan charge-offs. . | Ratio of provision for loan losses to net loan charge-offs. . | ## . Management capabilities . Earnings . . Earnings are considered high quality if they are adequate as well as sustainable. Ideally, the trend in earnings should be positive and the underlying accounting estimates should be unbiased. Finally, earnings should ideally be derived from recurring sources. . A major source of earnings of a bank is from investment in securities. Estimates used in the valuation of these securities may lead to biased earnings. . Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices of identical assets. . Level 2 inputs are observable but not quoted prices of identical assets. . Level 3 inputs are non-observable and hence subjective. . In practice, banks often use the fair value hierarchy to label their assets or to label their valuation methodology. . For a typical bank, major sources of earnings are (1) net interest income, (2) service income, and (3) trading income. Of these, trading income is the most volatile year-to-year, and, hence, on a relative basis, banks with proportionally higher net interest income and service income would have more sustainable earnings. . Liquidity Position . . Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) . LCR = highly liquid assets / expected cash outflows . Highly liquid assets are those that are easily convertiable into cash, while expected cash flows are the estimated on-month liquidity needs in a stress scenario. The standards recommend a minimum LCR of 100%. . Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) . NSFR = available stable funding / required stable funding . Available stable funding is a function of the composition and maturity distribution of a bank’s funding sources. Required stable funding is a function of the composition and maturity distribution of the bank’s asset base. . Funding Component ASF Factor   . Regulatory capital minus Tier 2 instruments maturing in a year | 100% | Equity | . Other capital instruments and liabilities with maturity &gt; 1 year | 95% |   | . Less-stable demand deposits and term deposits (maturity &lt; 1 year) from retail and small business customers | 90% |   | . Funding from nonfinancial corporates (maturity &lt; 1 year), operational deposits, funding from sovereigns, public sector (maturity &lt; 1 year), multilateral and national development banks | 50% |   | . All other liabilities | 0% | Short-term | . NSFR relates the liquidity needs of a bank’s assets to the liquidity provided by the bank’s liabilities. Longer-dated liabilities are considered more stable and hence would be suitable to fund assets with longer maturities. Deposits from retail and small business clients are considered more stable than deposits from corporate clients. The standards recommend a minimum NSFR of 100%. . Other liquidity monitoring metrics recommended by Basel III include concentration of funding and maturity mismatch. . Sensitivity to Market Risk . The most critical of various market risks is interest rate risk. A bank’s interest rate risk is the result of differences in maturity, rates, and repricing frequency between the bank’s assets and its liabilities. . The impact of market risk can be captured by value at risk (VaR). . Other Factors . Government support . | Government ownership . | Bank missions . | Culture . | . LOS 16.e: Analyze a bank based on financial statements and other factors. . LOS 16.f: Describe key ratios and other factors to consider in analyzing an insurance company. . Insurance company revenues include premium income and income on float. . Property and casualty (P &amp;C) insurers differ from life and health (L &amp;H) insurers in terms of variability of claims and contract duration. Claims form P &amp;V insurers tend to be lumpier as compared to relatively stable and predictable claims for L &amp;H insurers. Contract duration is much higher for L &amp;H insurers relative to that of P &amp;C insurers. Regulatory requirements that focus on solvency of insurance companies often result in different reporting standards compared to IFRS or US GAAP. . P &amp;C Insurance Companies . Premium income is usually the highest source of income for a P &amp;C insurer. Keys to the profitability of an insurer are prudence in underwriting, pricing of adequate premiums for bearing risk, and diversification of risk. To diversify their risks, insurers often reinsure some risks. The policy period is often very short, with premiums received at the beginning of the period and invested during the float period. Claim events are clearly defined but may take a long time to emerge. . Property insurance covers specific assets against loss due to insured events. Casualty insurance protects against a legal liability due to the occurrence of a covered event. Sometimes a poly, known as multiple peril policy, may cover both property and casualty losses occurring during a covered event. . P &amp;C Profitability . P &amp;C margins are cyclical. During periods of heightened competition, price cutting to obtain new business leads to slim or negative margins (soft pricing period). This soft pricing period leads to losses and a shrinking capital base for many insurers, who either leave the industry or stop underwriting new policies. The resulting reduction in competition leads to a healthier pricing environment (hard pricing period), which in turn results in fatter margins. Higher margins during the hard pricing period attract new competition, perpetuating the cycle. . Major expenses for P &amp;C insurers include claims expense and the expense of obtaining new policy business. The cost of writing new policies depends on whether the insurer uses a direct-to-customer model (in which case it would bear the fixed cost of staffing) or the agency model (in which case it would pay variable commissions). Soft or hard pricing is driven by the industry’s combined ratio (total insurance expenses / net premiums earned). When the ratio is low (high), it is a hard (soft) market. . For a single insurer, a combined ratio in excess of 100% indicates an underwriting loss. . Underwriting loss ratio (loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) = (claims paid + delta of loss reverse) / net premium earned . Expense ratio (underwriting expense ratio) = underwriting expenses including commissions / net premium written . The underwriting loss ratio measures the relative efficiency of the company’s underwriting standards (whether the policies are priced appropriately relative to risks borne), while the expense ratio measures the efficiency of the company’s operations. . For reporting purposes, sometimes insurers use US GAAP, which calls for net premium earned as the denominator for both ratios. . The loss reverse is an estimated value of unpaid claims (based on estimated losses incurred during the reporting period). Subject to management discretion in measurement, the loss reserve is a highly material amount. Insurers revise their estimate of the loss reserve as more information becomes available. Downward revisions indicate that the company was conservative in estimating their losses in the first place. Upward revisions indicate aggressive profit booking, a warning sign for analysts. . Other profitability ratios . Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio . Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio = (loss expense + loss adjustment expense) / net premiums earned . Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio measures the relative success in estimation of risks insured (lower is more successful). . Dividends to policyholders (shareholders) ratio . Dividends to policyholders ratio = dividends to policy holders (shareholders) / net premiums earned . Dividends to policyholders (shareholders) ratio is a liquidity measure measuring cash outflow on account of dividends relative to premium income. . Combined ratio = loss and loss adjustment expense ratio + underwriting expense ratio . Combined ratio after dividends (CRAD) . CRAD measures total efficiency and is more comprehensive than the combined ratio. . CRAD = combined ratio + dividends to policyholders ratio . Investment returns . Total investment return ratio = total investment income / invested assets . Total investment return ratio is used to evaluate the performance of an insurer’s investment operations. . Liquidity . Liquidity is an important consideration for P &amp;C insurers as they stand ready to meet their claim obligations. One way to gauge the liquidity of the investment portfolio is to look at their fair value hierarchy reporting. . Capitalization . There are no global risk-based capital requirement standards for insurers. Regionally, the EU has adopted the Solvency II standards, while NAIC in the United States has specified minimum capital levels based on size and risk (including asset, credit. Liquidity, underwriting, and other relevant risks). . L &amp;H Insurance companies . L &amp;H insurers derive their revenue primarily from premiums, while investment income is the secondary source. . Revenue diversification . | Earnings characteristics . | Investment returns . | Liquidity . | Capitalization . | LOS 17.a: Demonstrate the use of a conceptual framework for assessing the quality of a company’s financial reports. . . Reporting quality / Earnings quality로 나뉨 . Reporting Quality는 GAAP compliant &amp; low bias가 중요 . Earning quality는 Reporting Quality가 충족되었다는 전제 하에 high level &amp; sustainable이 중요 . High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information; information that is accurate as well as relevant. Low-quality reporting impedes assessment while high-quality reporting enables it. . The term high-quality earnings refers to a high level of earnings as well as sustainability of earnings. Good economic performance and sustainable earnings are considered high quality. Earnings quality is also referred to as result quality. . One cannot have both low-quality reporting and high-quality earnings; high-quality earnings assume high-quality reporting. However, one could have a situation in which the company has high quality reporting but low-quality earnings. . Financial reports quality (high to low) . GAAP compliant and decision-useful, high-quality earnings . | GAAP compliant and decision-useful, low-quality earnings . | GAAP compliant but not decision-useful, (biased choices) . | Non-compliant accounting . | Fraudulent accounting . | LOS 17.b: Explain potential problems that affect the quality of financial reports. . Measurement and timing issues . Aggressive revenue recognition / conservative revenue recognition . Classification issues . Misclassification . Removing accounts receivable by selling or transferring receivables to a related entity or by treating them as long-term receivables. . | Reclassifying non-core revenues as revenues from core continuing operations . | Reclassifying expenses as non-operating . | Treating investing cash flows as operating cash flows . | Biased accounting . Mechanisms to misstate profitability . Aggressive revenue recognition, including channel stuffing (aggressively selling products to distributors on generous terms such as lax return policies), bill and hold sales (where economic title to goods may not truly pass to customers), and outright fake sales. . | Lessor use of finance lease classification – sales-type lease . | Classifying non-operating revenue/income as operating, and operating expenses as non-operating. . | Channeling gains through net income and losses through OCI. . | . Warnings signs of misstated profitability . Revenue growth higher than peers’ . | Receivables growth higher than revenue growth . | High rate of customer returns . | High proportion of revenue is received in final quarter . | Unexplained boost to operating margin . | Operating cash flow lower than operating income . | Inconsistency in operating versus non-operating classification over time . | Aggressive accounting assumptions – high estimated useful lives . | Executive compensation largely tied to financial results. . | .

Warnings signs of overstated operating cash flows . Increase in payables combined with decreases in inventory and receivables. . | Capitalized expenditures which flow through investing activities. . | Increases in bank overdraft . | . Business combinations-acquisition method accounting . GAAP accounting but not economic reality . LOS 17.c: Describe how to evaluate the quality of a company’s financial reports. . LOS 17.d: Evaluate the quality of a company’s financial reports. . Understand the company, its industry, and the accounting principles it uses and why such principles are appropriate. . | Understand management including the terms of their compensation. Also evaluate any insider trades and related party transactions. . | Identify material areas of accounting that are vulnerable to subjectivity. . | Make cross-sectional and time series comparisons of financial statements and important ratios. . | Check for warning signs as discussed previously. . | For firms in multiple lines of business or for multinational firms, check for shifting of profits or revenues to a specific part of the business that the firm wants to highlight. This is particularly a concern when a specific segment shows dramatic improvement while the consolidated financials show negative or zero growth. . | Use quantitative tools to evaluate the likelihood of misreporting. . | Quantitative tools . The Beneish Model . . The Beneish model is a probit regression model that estimates the probability of earnings manipulation using eight dependent variables. The M-score determines the probability of earnings manipulation – higher values indicate high probabilities. . M-score &gt; -1.78 indicates a higher-than-acceptable probability of earnings manipulation. . DSRI (Days sales receivable index) – ratio of days’ sales receivables in year t relative to year t – 1. A large increase in DSRI could be indicative of revenue inflation. . | GMI (Gross margin index) – ratio of gross margin in year t – 1 to that in year t. a firm with declining margins is more likely to manipulate earnings. . | AQI (Asset quality index) – ratio of non-current assets other than plant, property, and equipment to total assets in year t relative to year t – 1. Increases in AQI could indicate excessive capitalization of expenses. . | SGI (Sales growth index) – ratio of sales in year t relative to year t – 1. While not a measure of manipulation by itself, growth companies tend to find themselves under pressure to manipulate earnings to meet ongoing expectations. . | DEPI (Depreciation index) – ratio of depreciation rate in year t – 1 to the corresponding rate in year t. the depreciation rate is depreciation expense divided by depreciation plus PPE. A DEPI greater than 1 suggests that assets are being depreciated at a slower rate in order to manipulate earnings. . | SGAI (Sales, general and administrative expenses index) – ratio of SGA expenses (as a % of sales) in year t relative to year t – 1. Increases in SGA expenses might predispose companies to manipulate. . | Accruals = (income before extraordinary items – cash flow from operations) / total assets . | LEVI (Leverage index) – ratio of total debt to total assets in year t relative to year t – 1. . | . ### . The Beneish model relies on accounting data, which may not reflect economic reality. Additionally, as managers become aware of the use of specific quantitative tools, they may begin to game the measures used. . Altman Model . . Altman’s Z-score model was developed to assess the probability that a firm will file for bankruptcy. . Net working capital as a proportion of total assets . | Retained earnings as a proportion of total assets . | Operating profit as a proportion of total assets . | Market value of equity relative to book value of liabilities . | Sales relative to total assets . | . Each variable is positively related to the Z-scores, and a higher Z-score is better (less likelihood of bankruptcy). . LOS 17.f: Describe indicators of earnings quality. . Sustainable – high-quality earnings tend to persist in the future. . Adequate – high-quality earnings cover the company’s cost of capital. . High-quality earnings assume high-quality reporting. . LOS 17.e: Describe the concept of sustainable (persistent) earnings. . Sustainable or persistent earnings are earnings that are expected to recur in the future. . Accruals . . Accrual accounting requires considerable subjectivity because of the many estimates and judgments involved with assigning revenues and expenses to appropriate periods. Due to this subjectivity in revenue and expense recognition, disaggregating income into its two major components, cash and accruals, further enhances its quality as an input for forecasting future earnings. The accrual component of income is less persistent than the cash component. . LOS 17.g: Explain mean reversion in earnings and how the accruals component of earnings affects the speed of mean reversion. . When examining net income, analysts should be aware that earnings at extreme levels tend to revert back to normal levels over time. This phenomenon is known as mean reversion. Because of mean reversion, analysts should not expect extreme earnings to continue indefinitely. When earnings are largely comprised of accruals, mean reversion will occur faster. . LOS 17.h: Evaluate the earnings quality of a company. . Revenue recognition issues . Revenues generated via deliberate channel-stuffing or as a result of bill-and-hold arrangements should be considered spurious and inferior. . Cash versus accruals . | Compare financials with physical data provided by the company . | Evaluate revenue trends and compare with peers . | Check for related party transactions . | Expense capitalization . One way to boost reported performance is to under-report an operating expense by capitalizing it. . LOS 17.i: Describe indicators of cash flow quality. . While cash flows are less amenable to manipulation management can affect cash flows via strategic decisions (timing issues). . LOS 17.j: Evaluate the cash flow quality of a company. . Analysts should be aware that accounting standards afford some flexibility in the treatment of certain items in the statement of cash flows. . LOS 17.k: Describe indicators of balance sheet quality. . LOS 17.l: Evaluate the balance sheet quality of a company. . Completeness . In the case of intercorporate investments, the equity method of accounting allows one-line consolidation for investments in associates. The equity method of accounting would result in certain profitability ratios being higher than under the acquisition method. . Unbiased measurement . Value of the pension liability (based on several actuarial assumptions) . | Value of investment in debt or equity of other companies for which a market value is not readily available. . | Goodwill value (subjectivity in impairment testing) . | Inventory valuation (subjectivity in testing for impairment) . | Impairment of PP &amp;E and other assets . | .

LOS 18.b: Identify financial reporting choices and biases that affect the quality and comparability of companies’ financial statements and explain how such biases may affect financial decisions. . LOS 18.c: Evaluate the quality of a company’s financial data and recommend appropriate adjustments to improve quality and comparability with similar companies, including adjustments for differences in accounting standards, methods, and assumptions. . Sources of earnings and return on equity . ROE = Tax Burden * Interest Burden * EBIT margin * Total Asset Turnover * Financial Leverage . . We must also consider the firm’s sources of income and whether the income is generated internally from operations or externally. . Eliminating the equity income from the investor’s earnings permits analysis of the investor’s performance resulting exclusively from its own asset base. Since, under the equity method, the firm’s investment is reported as a balance sheet asset, total assets should be reduced by the carrying value of investment. . Another common adjustment made by analysts is to remove the effects of any unusual items (e.g., provisions for restructuring and litigation, goodwill impairment, etc.) from reported operating earnings (EBIT) before computing the EBIT margin and the tax burden ratios. . Asset base . Analysis of the asset base requires an examination of changes in the composition of balance sheet assets over time. . Since goodwill is no longer amortized through the income statement, we must consider the possibility of losses in the future if goodwill is determined to have been impaired. . Capital structure . A firm’s capital structure must be able to support management’s strategic objectives as well as to allow the firm to honor its future obligations. . Capital allocation decisions . Consolidated financial statements can hide the individual characteristics of dissimilar subsidiaries. As a result, firms are required to disaggregate financial information by segments to assists users. . Accrual-based measures such as EBIT may not be a good indicator of an entity’s ability to generate cash flow. We would rather evaluate segmental capital allocation decisions based on cash flows generated by each segment. However, segmental cash flow data is generally not reported. We can, however, approximate cash flow as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. . LOS 18.d: Evaluate how a given change in accounting standards, methods, or assumptions affects financial statements and ratios. . LOS 18.e: analyze and interpret how balance sheet modifications, earnings normalization, and cash flow statement related modifications affect a company’s financial statements, financial ratios, and overall financial condition. . Accruals ratio . Balance sheet approach . Accruals BS = ending NOA – beginning NOA . Net Operating Assets (NOA) = Operating assets – Operating liabilities . Operating assets = total assets – cash, equivalents to cash, marketable securities . Operating liabilities = total liabilities – total debt (both short term and long term) . Accruals ratio BS = (ending NOA – beginning NOA) / ((ending NOA + beginning NOA) / 2) . Cash flow statement approach . Accruals CF = NI – CFO – CFI . Accruals ratio CF = (NI – CFO – CFI) / ((ending NOA – beginning NOA) / 2) . In order to compare the two measures, it is necessary to eliminate cash paid for interest and taxes from operating cash flow by adding them back. This adjusted figure is the cash generated from operations (CGO). . CGO = EBIT + non-cash charges – increase in working capital . CGO / operating income ratio 사용함 . Market value decomposition . When a parent company has an ownership interest in an associate (subsidiary or affiliate), it may be beneficial to determine the standalone value of the parent; that is, the implied value of the parent without regard to the value of the associate. The implied value is equal to the parent’s market value less the parent’s pro-rata share of the associate’s market value. If the associate’s stock is traded on a foreign stock exchange, it may be necessary to convert the market value of the associate to the parent’s reporting currency. .",

LOS 37.b: Calculate and interpret the no-arbitrage value of equity, interest rate, fixed-income, and currency forward and futures contracts. . . Forward contract . Long forward position – agrees to buy the financial or physical asset . Short forward position – agrees to sell/deliver the asset . Typically, no money changes hands at the inception of the contract, unlike futures contracts. . At any point in time, forward contract is a zero-sum game. . The no-arbitrage principle . Forward price refers to the forward price of the underlying. . No-arbitrage principle - The price that we wish to determine is the forward price that makes the values of both the long and the short positions zero at contract initiation. There should be no riskless profit to be gained by a combination of a forward contract position with positions in other assets. . This principle assumes that (1) transactions costs are zero, (2) there are no restrictions on short sales or the use of short sale proceeds, and (3) both borrowing and lending can be done in unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate of interest. . Forward price = price that prevents profitable riskless arbitrage in frictionless markets . A simple version of the cost-of-carry model . . Cash and carry arbitrage when the forward contract is overpriced compared to no-arbitrage price . . Reverse cash and carry arbitrage when the forward contract is underprice compared to no-arbitrage price . Short spot asset, long forward . Day count convention . . All LIBOR-based contracts such as FRAs, swaps, caps, floors, etc . 360 days per year and simple interest . Equities, bonds, currencies, and stock options . 365 days per year and periodic compound interest . Equity indexes . 365 days per year and continuous compounding . Pricing and valuation of equity forwards . Equity forward contracts with discrete dividends . . . 진정한 기초자산이 뭔지 확인하고, 그 기초자산을 무위험 이자율로 굴려나가면 forward price . . . Equity forward contracts with continuous dividends . Underlying asset is an equity index. . Continuous dividend는 dividend yield로 표시됨 . . Pricing and valuation of fixed income forwards . . . Clean price는 해당 주기에서의 bond 가격 . Full price는 실제 bond market에서 거래되는 가격, 해당 bond를 사려면 지불해야 하는 실제 가격 – accrued interest 포함 . UST – semiannual . Bond futures contracts often allow the short an option to deliver any of several bonds, which will satisfy the delivery terms of the contract. This is called a delivery option and is valuable to the short. Each bond is given a conversion factor that is used to adjust the long’s payment at delivery so the more valuable bonds receive a lager payment. These factors are multipliers for the futures price at settlement. The long pays the futures price at expiration, multiplied by the conversion factor (CF). . . 가격표시는 clean price로 되지만, 실제 futures price를 거래할 때는 accrued interest의 현재가치를 빼준 full price를 사용해야 한다. . . . . Pricing forward rate agreements . LIBOR – London Interbank Offered Rate . It is quoted as an annualized rate based on a 360-day year. . . The long position in a forward rate agreement (FRA) is the party that is effectively borrowing money (long the loan, with the contract price being the interest rate on the loan). . Pricing FRAs . LIBOR rates in the Eurodollar market are add-on rates and are always quoted on a 30/360 day basis in annual terms. . | The long position in an FRA is, in effect, long the rate and benefits when the rate increases. . | Although the interest on the underlying loan won’t be paid until the end of the loan. Therefore, the payoff on the FRA is the present value of the interest savings on the loan. . | The forward price in an FRA is actually a forward interest rate. . Valuation of forward rate agreements . . . Pricing and valuation of currency contracts . Interest rate parity is based on a no-arbitrage condition: a higher interest rate currency will trade at a forward discount to offset the extra interest income. . . . 항상 가격 표시는 price currency (foreign currency)로 . . . . Futures contract . Futures contract are very much like the forward contracts except that they trade on organized exchanges. . To safeguard the clearinghouse, the exchange requires both sides of the trade to post margin and settle their accounts on a daily basis. Thus, the margin in the futures markets is a performance guarantee. . Marking to market is the process of adjusting the margin balance in a futures account each day for the change in the value of the contract from the previous trading day, based on the settlement price. . Like forward contracts, futures contracts have no value at contract initiation. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts do not accumulate value changes over the term of the contract. Since futures accounts are marked to market daily, the value after the margin deposit has been adjusted for the day’s gains and losses in contract value is always zero. . LOS 37.c: Describe and compare how interest rate, currency, and equity swaps are priced and valued. . LOS 37.d: Calculate and interpret the no-arbitrage value of interest rate, currency, and equity swaps. . One party agrees to pay floating (borrow at the floating rate) and receive fixed (lend at a fixed rate). At initiation of the swap, the fixed rate is selected so that the present value of the floating-rate payments is equal to the present value of the fixed-rate payments, which means the swap value is zero to both parties. This fixed rate is called the swap fixed rate. . Computing the swap fixed rate . . . . . Calculating the market value of an interest rate swap . . . Currency swaps . The interest rates in a currency swap are simply the swap rates calculated from each country’s yield curve in the relevant country’s currency. . . . . . Equity swaps . A swap of returns on two different stocks can be viewed as buying one stock (receiving the returns) and shorting an equal value of a different stock (paying the returns). There is on pricing at swap initiation. . . . . . LOS 38.a: Describe and interpret the binomial option valuation model and its component terms. . LOS 38.b: Calculate the no-arbitrage values of European and American options using a two-period binomial model. . LOS 38.e: Describe how the value of a European option can be analyzed as the present value of the option’s expected payoff at expiration. . A binomial model is based on the idea that, over the next period, the value of an asset will change to one of two possible values (binomial). To construct a binomial model, we need to know the beginning asset value, the size of the two possible changes, and the probability of each of these changes occurring. . . Calculating the payoff of the option at maturity in both the up-move and down-move states. . | Calculating the expected value of the option in one year as the probability-weighted average of the payoffs in each state. . | Discounting the expected value back to today at the risk-free rate. . | . . . Two period binomial model and put-call parity . . Put call parity can be used to create a synthetic instrument that replicates the desired instrument. . . . . . American option . While the early exercise feature is not valuable for call options on non-dividend paying stocks, deep-in-the-money put options could benefit from early exercise. When an investor exercises an option early, she captures only the intrinsic value of the option and forgoes the time value. While the intrinsic value can be invested at the risk-free rate, the interest so earned is less than the time value in most cases. For deep-in-the-money put option, the upside is limited. In such cases, the interest on intrinsic value can exceed the option’s time value. . American-style call options on dividend-paying stocks can be evaluated similarly. For dividend-paying stocks the stock price falls when the stock goes ex-dividend, and it may take sense to exercise the call option before such a decline in price. . . . . LOS 38.c: Identify an arbitrage opportunity involving options and describe the related arbitrage. . . The fractional share of stock needed in the arbitrage trade (hedge ratio or delta) . LOS 38.d: Calculate and interpret the value of an interest rate option using a two-period binomial model. . The interest rates are selected so that the risk-neutral probabilities of up- and down-moves are both equal to 0.5. . Call payoff = notional principal * Max(0, reference rate – exercise rate) . Maturity 시점에서 바로 settelement되는 가정 . . LOS 38.f: Identify assumptions of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. . The BSM option valuation model values options in continuous time, but it based on the no-arbitrage condition we used in valuing options in discrete time with a binomial model. To derive the BSM model, an instantaneously riskless portfolio (one that is riskless over the next instant) is used to solve for the option price. . The assumptions underlying the BSM model are . The underlying asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion process. Therefore, the asset price has a lognormal distribution. In other words, the continuous compounded return is normally distributed. Under this framework, change in asset price is continuous: there are no abrupt jumps. . | The continuous compounded risk-free rate is constant and known. Borrowing and lending are both at the risk-free rate. . | The volatility of the returns from inception to maturity on the underlying asset is constant and known. The price of the underlying changes smoothly. . | Markets are frictionless. There are no taxes, no transactions costs, and no restrictions on short sales or the use of short-sale proceeds. Continuous trading is possible, and there are no arbitrage opportunities in the marketplace. . | The continuously compounded yield from inception to maturity on the underlying asset is constant. . | The options are European options. . | . . LOS 38.g: Interpret the components of the Black-Scholes-Merton model as applied to call options in terms of a leveraged position in the underlying. . The BSM value can be thought of as the present value of the expected option payoff at expiration. . Calls can be thought of as a leveraged stock investment where N(d1) units of stock are purchased using borrowed funds. . N(d2) is interpreted as the risk-neutral probability that a call option will expire in the money. . . . . . LOS 38.h: Describe how the Black-Scholes-Merton model is used to value European options on equities and currencies. . . LOS 38.i: Describe how the Black model is used to value European options on futures. . . The value of a call option on futures is equal to the value of a portfolio with a long futures position (the PV of the futures price multiplied by N(d1)) and a short bond position (the PV of the exercise price multiplied by N(d2)) . The value of a put option is equal to the value of portfolio with a long bond and a short futures position. . The value of a call can also be thought of as the present value of the difference between the futures price adjusted by N(d1) and the exercise price adjusted by N(d2). . LOS 38.j: Describe how the Black model is used to value European interest rate options and European swaptions. . . Interest rate options are options on forward rates (or options on FRAs). A call option on an FRA gains when rates rise, and a put option on an FRA gains when rates fall. . Equivalencies in interest rate derivatives contracts . A long interest rate call and a short interest rate put (with exercise rate = current FRA rate) can be used to replicate a long FRA. . | If the exercise rate = the current FRA rate, a short interest rate call and long interest rate put can be combined to replicate a short FRA position. . | A series of interest rate call options with different maturities and the same exercise price can be combined to form an interest rate cap. Each of the call options in an interest rate cap is known as a caplet. A floating rate loan can be hedged using a long interest rate bond. . | An interest rate floor is a portfolio of interest rate put options, and each of these puts is known as a floorlet. Floors can be used to hedge a long position in a floating rate bond. . | If the exercise rate on a cap and floor is same, a long cap and short floor can be used to replicate a payer swap. . | A short cap and long floor can replicate a receiver swap. . | If the exercise rate on a floor and a cap are set equal to a market swap fixed rate, the value of the cap will be equal to the value of the floor. . | . . . . . Swaptions . A swaption is an option that gives the holder the right to enter into an interest rate swap. . . . A swaption is equivalent to an option on a series of cash flows (annuity), one for each settlement date of the underlying swap, equal to the difference between the exercise rate on the swaption and the market swap fixed rate. . If PVA represents the present value of such an annuity, the value of a payer swaption using the Black model can be calculated. . Equivalencies . A long callable bond can be replicated using a long position option-free bond plus a short receiver swaption. . . . LOS 38.k: Interpret each of the option Greeks. . . Delta . Delta describes the relationship between changes in asset prices and changes in option prices. Delta is also the hedge ratio. Call option deltas are positive because as the underlying asset price increases, call option value also increases. Conversely, the delta of a put option is negative because put value falls as the asset price increases. . Interpreting Delta . The bottom line is that a call option’s delta will increase from 0 to 1 as non-dividend paying stock price increase. For a non-dividend paying stock, the put delta increases from -1 to 0 as the stock price increases. . . . . Gamma . Gamma measures the rate of changes in delta as the underlying stock price changes. Gamma captures the curvature of the option-value-versus-stock-price relationship. Long positions in calls and puts have positive gamma. . Gamma is highest for at-the-money options. Deep-in-the-money or deep-out-of-the-money options have low gamma. Gamma changes with stock price and with time to expiration. To lower (increase) the overall gamma of a portfolio, one should short (go long) options. . Call and put options on the same underlying asset with the same exercise price and time to expiration will have equal gammas. . . Vega . Vega measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the volatility of returns on the underlying asset. Both call and put options are more valuable, all else equal, the higher the volatility, so vega is positive for both calls and puts. . Rho . Rho measures the sensitivity of the option price to change in the risk-free rate. . . Theta . Theta measures the sensitivity of option price to the passage of time. As time passes and a call option approaches maturity, its speculative value declines, all else equal. This is called time decay. That behavior also applied for most put options (though deep in-the-money put options closed to maturity may actually increases in value as time passes). Because it is a measure of time decay, theta is less than zero: as time passes and the option approaches the maturity date, the option value decreases (holding other factors constant). . . . Sensitivity factor (Greeks) Input Long call Long put . Delta | Asset price | Positively related | Negatively related | . Gamma | Delta | Positive | Positive | . Vega | Volatility | Positive | Positive | . Rho | Risk-free rate | Positive | Negative | . Theta | Time to expiration | Negative | Negative | .   | Exercise price | Negatively related | Positively related | . LOS 38.l: Describe how a delta hedge is executed. . The goal of a delta-neutral portfolio or delta-neutral hedge is to combine a long position in a stock with a short position in a call option so that the value of the portfolio does not change as the stock price changes. . Number of short call options needed to delta hedge = number of shares hedged / delta of call option . Number of long put options needed to delta hedge = - number of shares hedged / delta of put option . A key consideration in delta-neutral hedging is that the delta hedged asset position is only risk-free for a very small change in the value of the underlying stock. The delta-neutral portfolio must be continually rebalanced to maintain the hedge; for this reason, it is called a dynamic hedge. . . . LOS 38.m: Describe the role of gamma risk in option trading. . Gamma risk is therefore the risk that the stock price might abruptly jump leaving an otherwise delta-hedged portfolio unhedged. . Consider a delta hedge involving a long position in stock and short position in calls. If the stock price falls abruptly, the loss in the long stock position will not equal to gain in the short call position. This is the gamma risk of the hedge. . Because a stock’s delta is always 1, its gamma is 0. A delta-hedged portfolio with a long position in stocks and a short position in calls with have negative net gamma exposures. . LOS 38.n: Define implied volatility and explain how it is used in options trading. . Future volatility is one of the inputs in the BSM model. Estimates based on historical volatility are often used because future volatility is not directly observable. . Traders often use implied volatilities to gauge market perceptions. .

An increase in a firm’s product price will not be followed by its competitors but a decrease in price will. . | Kink is the profit-maximizing level of output . | | Cournot duopoly model . Two firms with identical marginal cost curves each choose their preferred selling price based on the price the other firm chose in the previous period. | | Nash equilibrium model (prisoner’s dilemma) . When the choices of all firms are such that there is no other choice that makes any firm better off (increases profits or decreases losses) | | Stackelberg dominant firm model . One firm is the ‘leader’ and chooses its price first, and the other firm chooses a price based on the leader’s price. In equilibrium, the leader charges a higher price and receives a greater proportion of the firms’ total profits. | | Dominant firm model . Demand curve is more elastic | | In general, collusive agreements to increase price in an oligopoly market will be more successful (have less cheating) when . There are fewer firms . | Products are more similar (less differentiated) . | Cost structures are more similar . | Purchases are relatively small and frequent . | Retaliation by other firms for cheating is more certain and more severe . | There is less actual or potential competition from firms outside the cartel . | .

National defense industries should be protected. . | Infant industries should be protected. . | Trade with low-wage countries does not itself depress wage rates since productivity must be considered. . | . For a perfectly competitive firm, maximum profit occurs at the output level where MR = MC. And, since the demand curve faced by each firm in perfect competition is horizontal, MR is equal to price. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
